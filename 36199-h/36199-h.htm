<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame de Bracieux</span> was working for her poor
people. She poked her thick, light, tortoise-shell
crochet-needle into the ball of coarse wool, and
putting that down on her lap, lifted her head and
looked across at her great-nephew, Jean de Blaye.</p>

<p>"Jean," she said, "what are you gazing at that
is so interesting? You stand there with your nose
flattened against the window-pane, just exactly
as you did when you were a little boy, and were so
insufferable."</p>

<p>Jean de Blaye lifted his head abruptly. He had
been leaning his forehead against the glass of the
bay-window.</p>

<p>"I?" he answered, hesitating slightly. "Oh,
nothing, aunt&mdash;nothing at all!"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all? Oh, well, I must say that
you seem to be looking at nothing at all with a
great deal of attention."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not believe him, grandmamma!" said
Madame de Rueille in her beautiful, grave, expressive
voice; "he is hoping all the time to see a cab
appear round the bend of the avenue."</p>

<p>"Is he expecting someone?" asked the
marchioness.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" explained M. de Rueille, laughing;
"but a cab, even a Pont-sur-Loire cab,
would remind him of Paris. Bertrade is teasing
him."</p>

<p>"I don't care all that much about being reminded
of Paris," muttered Jean, without stirring.</p>

<p>Madame de Rueille gazed at him in astonishment.
"One would almost think he was in
earnest!" she remarked.</p>

<p>"In earnest, but absent-minded!" said the
marchioness, and then, turning towards a young
abbé, who was playing loto with the de Rueille
children, she asked:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, will you tell us whether there is anything
interesting taking place on the terrace?"</p>

<p>The abbé, who was seated with his back to the
bay-window, looked behind him over his shoulder,
and replied promptly:</p>

<p>"I do not see anything in the slightest degree
interesting, madame."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing whatever," affirmed Jean, leaving the
window, and taking his seat on a divan.</p>

<p>One of the de Rueille children, forgetting his
loto cards, and leaving the abbé to call out the
numbers over and over again with untiring patience,
suddenly perched himself up on a chair, and, by his
grimaces, appeared to be making signals to someone
through the window.</p>

<p>"Marcel dear, at whom are you making those
horrible grimaces?" asked the grandmother,
puzzled.</p>

<p>"At Bijou," replied the child; "she is out there
gathering flowers."</p>

<p>"Has she been there long?" asked the
marchioness.</p>

<p>It was the abbé who answered this time.</p>

<p>"About, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour,
madame."</p>

<p>"And you consider that Bijou is not interesting
to look at?" exclaimed the old lady, laughing.
"You are difficult to please, monsieur!"</p>

<p>Abbé Courteil, who had not been long in the
family, and who was incredibly shy, blushed from
the neck-band of his cassock to the roots of his fair
hair, and stammered out in dismay:</p>

<p>"But, madame, when you asked if anything
interesting were taking place on the terrace, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
thought you meant&mdash;something&mdash;something extraordinary,
and I never thought that the presence
of Mademoiselle Bij&mdash;I mean, of Mademoiselle
Denyse&mdash;as she always gathers her flowers there
at this time every day&mdash;I never thought that you
would consider that as&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence ended in an unintelligible way,
whilst the abbé, very much confused, continued
shaking the numbers about in the bag.</p>

<p>"That poor abbé," said Bertrade de Rueille,
very quietly, "you do frighten him, grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! nothing of the kind! I do not
frighten him; you exaggerate, my dear."</p>

<p>And then, after a moment's reflection, Madame
de Bracieux continued:</p>

<p>"The man must be blind then."</p>

<p>"What man?"</p>

<p>"Why, your abbé! Good heavens, what stupid
answers he makes."</p>

<p>"But, grandmamma&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! you will never make me believe that
a man could watch Bijou at work amongst the
flowers, and not consider her '<i>interesting to look
at</i>!'&mdash;no, never!"</p>

<p>"A man, yes; but then the abbé is not exactly
a man."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! what is he then, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Well, a priest is not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not exactly like other men in certain respects!
no, at least I hope not; but priests have eyes, I
suppose, and you will grant that, if they have not
eyes like those of other men, they have eyes such
as a woman has, at any rate. Will you allow your
abbé to have eyes like a woman?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, grandmamma, I will allow him to
have any kind of eyes he likes."</p>

<p>"That's a good thing. Well, then, any woman
looking at Bijou would perceive that she is charming.
Why should an abbé not perceive that
too?"</p>

<p>"You do not like our poor abbé."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you know my opinion. I consider
that priests were made for the churches and not
for our houses. Apart from that, I like your abbé
as well as I do any of them. I like him&mdash;negatively;
I respect him."</p>

<p>Bertrade laughed, and said in her gentle voice:</p>

<p>"It scarcely seems like it; you are very rough
on him always."</p>

<p>"I am rough on him, just as I am rough on all
of you."</p>

<p>"Yes, but then we are accustomed to it, whilst
he&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, very well, I won't be rough on him again.
I will take care; but you have no idea how tiresome
it will be to me. I do like to be able to
speak my mind. It was a strange notion of yours,
to have an abbé for your children."</p>

<p>"It was Paul; he particularly wished the children
to be educated by a priest, at any rate, to begin
with. He is very religious."</p>

<p>"Well, but so am I&mdash;I am very religious, and
that is just why I would never have a priest as
tutor. Yes, don't you see, if he should be an intelligent
man, why, just for the sake of one or two,
or even several children&mdash;but anyhow only a small
number, you make use of his intelligence, which
his calling had destined for the direction of his
flock, and you prevent him from teaching, comforting,
and forgiving the sins of poor creatures,
who, as a rule, are much more interesting than
we are. If, on the other hand, the priest should be
an imbecile, why, he just devotes himself conscientiously
to distorting the mind of the little human
being entrusted to him, and in both cases you are
responsible, either for the harm you do, or the
good you prevent being done&mdash;-Ah! here's Bijou,
let me look at her; I shall enjoy that more than
talking about your abbé," and the marchioness
pointed to her grand-daughter, who was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
entering the room, and who looked like a walking
basket of flowers.</p>

<p>Denyse de Courtaix, nicknamed Bijou, was an
exquisite little creature, refined-looking, graceful,
and slender, and yet all over dimples. She
had large violet eyes, limpid, and full of expression,
a straight nose, turning up almost imperceptibly
at the end, a very small mouth, with
very red lips going up merrily at the corners, and
showing some small, milky-white teeth. Her
soft, silky hair was of that light auburn shade
so rarely seen nowadays. Her tiny ears were
shaded with pink, like mother-of-pearl, and this
same pinky shade was to be seen not only on
her cheeks, but on her forehead, her neck, and her
hands. It shone all over her skin with a rosy
gleam. Her eyebrows alone, which crossed her
smooth, intelligent forehead with a very fine, and
almost unbroken dark line, indicated the fact that
this frail and pretty little creature had a will of her
own.</p>

<p>Bijou, who looked about fifteen or sixteen years
of age, had attained her majority just a week ago,
but from her perfect and dainty little person there
seemed to emanate a breath of child-like candour
and innocence. Her charm, however, which was
most subtle and penetrating, was distinctly that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a woman, and it was this contrast which made
Bijou so fascinating and so unlike other girls. Such
as she was, she infatuated men, delighted women,
and was adored by all.</p>

<p>As soon as she entered the room, all rosy-looking
in her pink dress of cloudy muslin, with a sort
of flat basket filled with roses, fastened round her
neck with pink ribbon, everyone surrounded her,
glad to welcome the gaiety which seemed to enter
with her, for until her arrival the large room had
felt somewhat bare and empty.</p>

<p>Paul de Rueille, who was playing billiards with
his brother-in-law, Henry de Bracieux, came to
ask for a rose from her basket, whilst Henry, who
had followed him, took one without asking.</p>

<p>The de Rueille children, leaving the abbé, who
continued calling out the loto numbers in a
monotonous tone, went sliding across to the young
girl, and hung about her. Their mother called
them back.</p>

<p>"Leave Bijou alone, children; you worry
her!"</p>

<p>"Robert! Marcel! come here," said the abbé,
getting up.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," protested Bijou, "let them alone; I
like to have them!"</p>

<p>She took the basket from her neck, and was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
about to put it down on the billiard-table, when
she suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I must have mercy on the game."</p>

<p>"Isn't she nice? she thinks of everything,"
murmured Henry de Bracieux, quite
touched.</p>

<p>"Come and kiss me, Bijou," said the marchioness.</p>

<p>Denyse had just put her basket down on a
divan. She took from it a full-blown rose, and
went quickly across to her grandmother, whom she
kissed over and over again in a fondling way as
a child.</p>

<p>"There," she said, presenting her rose, "it is the
most beautiful one of all!" Her voice was rather
high-pitched, rather "a head-voice" perhaps, but
it sounded so young and clear, and then, too, she
spoke so distinctly, and with such an admirable
pronunciation.</p>

<p>"You have not seen Pierrot, then?" asked the
marchioness.</p>

<p>"Pierrot?" said Bijou, as though she were trying
to recall something to her memory. "Why, yes,
I have seen him; he was with me a minute or two
helping me to gather the flowers, and then he went
away to his father, who was shooting rabbits in the
wood."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I might have thought as much; that boy does
not do a thing."</p>

<p>"But, grandmamma, he is here for his holidays."</p>

<p>"His holidays if you like; but, all the same, if a
tutor has been engaged for him, it is surely so that
he may work."</p>

<p>"But he must take some rest now and again,
poor Pierrot&mdash;and his tutor too."</p>

<p>"They do nothing else, though. Well, as long
as my brother knows it, and as long as it suits
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It suits him to-day, anyhow, for he told them
to join him in the wood."</p>

<p>"He told <i>them</i>?" repeated the old lady; and
then she continued slily, "and so the tutor has
been gathering roses, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Denyse, with her beautiful, frank
smile, and not noticing her grandmother's mocking
intonation, "he has been gathering roses, too."</p>

<p>"He probably enjoyed that more than shooting
rabbits," said the marchioness, glancing at a tall
young man who was just entering the room, "for
if he went to join your uncle in the wood, he did
not stay long with him anyhow!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no!"&mdash;said Bijou in astonishment, and
then leaving her grandmother, she advanced to
meet the young man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you not find uncle, Monsieur Giraud?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mademoiselle," he replied, turning very
red. "Yes, certainly, we found M. de Jonzac;
but&mdash;I&mdash;I was obliged to come in&mdash;as I have
some of Pierre's exercises to correct." And then,
doubtlessly wanting to explain how it was that he
had come into that room, he added, slightly
confused: "I just came in here to see whether I
had left my books about&mdash;I thought&mdash;but&mdash;I do
not see them here&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had not taken his eyes off Bijou, and was
going away again when the marchioness, looking at
him indulgently, and with an amused expression in
her eyes, called him back.</p>

<p>"Will you not stay and have a smoke here,
Monsieur Giraud? Is there such a hurry as all
that for the correction of those exercises?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, madame!" answered the tutor eagerly,
retracing his steps, "there is no hurry at all."</p>

<p>The old lady leaned forward towards Madame
de Rueille, who was silently working at a handsome
piece of tapestry, and said to her with a smile:
"He is not like the abbé&mdash;this young man!"</p>

<p>Bertrade lifted her pretty head and answered
gravely:</p>

<p>"No!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"You look as though you pitied him?"</p>

<p>"I do, with all my heart."</p>

<p>"And why, pray?"</p>

<p>"Because the poor fellow, after coming to us as
gay as a lark a fortnight ago, and winning all our
hearts, will go away from here sad and unhappy,
his heart heavy with grief or anger."</p>

<p>"Oh, you always see the black side of things; he
thinks Bijou is sweet, he admires her and likes to
be with her; but that is all!"</p>

<p>"You know very well, grandmamma, that Bijou
is perfectly adorable, and so attractive that everyone
is fascinated by her."</p>

<p>The marchioness pointed to her great-nephew,
Jean de Blaye, who, ever since he had left the
window, did not appear to be taking any notice
of what was going on around him.</p>

<p>"Everyone?" she said, almost angrily; "no, not
everyone. Look at Jean, he is as blind as the
abbé!"</p>

<p>Jean de Blaye was sitting motionless in a large
arm-chair; there was an impassive expression on
his face, and a far-away look in his eyes. He
appeared to be in a reverie, and the younger lady
glanced across at him, as she answered:</p>

<p>"I am afraid that he is only acting blind!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" said Madame de Bracieux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
delighted, "do you think that Bijou could possibly
interest Jean enough, for instance, to keep him,
even for a time, from his actresses, his horses, his
theatres, and the stupid life he generally leads?&mdash;You
really think so?"</p>

<p>"I do think so!"</p>

<p>"And how long have you thought this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, only just now. When he told us with
such conviction that '<i>he did not care all that much
about being reminded of Paris</i>,' I felt that he was
speaking the truth. I began to wonder then what
could have made him forget Paris. I wondered
and wondered&mdash;and I found out."</p>

<p>"Bijou?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"So much the better if that really should be so.
For my part, I do not think it looks like it. He
takes no notice of her."</p>

<p>"When we are watching him&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"He seems low-spirited and absent-minded."</p>

<p>"He would be for less cause than this. Jean never
does things in a half-and-half way. If he were in love,
I mean seriously, he would be desperately in love;
and if he were to be desperately in love with Bijou, or
if he were to discover that he was falling in love
with her, it certainly would not be a thing for him
to rejoice over. He cannot&mdash;no matter how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he might wish it&mdash;he cannot marry Bijou. It is
not only that he is her cousin, but he is not rich
enough."</p>

<p>"He has about twenty thousand pounds. Bijou
has eight thousand, to which I shall add another
four thousand, that makes twelve thousand&mdash;total
between them thirty-two thousand."</p>

<p>"Well, and can you imagine Bijou with an income
of about nine hundred pounds a year?"</p>

<p>"No. I know that <i>she</i> would consider it enough.
She makes her own dresses; everyone says they
do that, but, in this case, it is a fact. Then she is
very industrious and clever; she understands
housekeeping wonderfully well, and for the last
four years has managed everything both here and
in Paris; but I could not possibly reconcile myself
to the idea of seeing her enduring the hardships
of a limited income&mdash;and it would be limited.
Good heavens! though, I hope she will not go
and fall in love with Jean."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do not think she will."</p>

<p>"You see, he is charming, the wretch; and it
appears he is a great favourite?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly; but then Bijou is made so
much of. She is surrounded and adored by everyone,
so that she has not much time to fall in love
herself!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then, too, she is such a child!" said
the marchioness, glancing at her grand-daughter
with infinite tenderness.</p>

<p>Bijou was standing near the billiard-table
watching the game, and laughing as she teased the
players.</p>

<p>At a little distance from her, the young professor
was also standing motionless, watching her with a
rapturous expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jean de Blaye rose abruptly, looking
annoyed, and moved away in the direction of the
door that led to the flight of steps going down to
the garden.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" called out Denyse, "wait, and
let me give you a flower!"</p>

<p>She went to the basket, and taking out a yellow
rose scarcely opened, she crossed over to her cousin,
and put it in his button-hole.</p>

<p>"There!" she said, stepping back and looking
satisfied, "you are very fine like that!" And then
turning towards the tutor, she said in the most
winning way, and with perfect ease: "Monsieur
Giraud, will you have a rosebud too?"</p>

<p>The young man took the flower, and, almost
trembling with confusion, tried in vain to fasten it
in his coat.</p>

<p>"Ah! you can't do it!" said the young girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
taking it gently from him. "Let me put it in
for you, will you?"</p>

<p>He was so tall that, in order to reach his button-hole,
she was obliged to stand on tip-toes. She
slipped the flower through slowly, and with
the greatest care, and when she had finished
she gave a little tap to the shiny revers of
the old coat, which were all out of shape and
faded.</p>

<p>"There, that's right!" she said, smiling
pleasantly; "like that, it is perfectly lovely!"</p>

<p>The marchioness, her eyes shining with affection,
was looking at her.</p>

<p>"What do you think of her? isn't she sweet?"
the old lady said to Bertrade, who seemed to be
admiring Bijou also.</p>

<p>Madame de Rueille looked at the young tutor,
who was standing still in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" she said.</p>

<p>"What, still! Well, decidedly, Monsieur Giraud
appears to interest you very much!"</p>

<p>"Very much indeed! I am sorry for people
who are sensitive and unhappy; for, you see,
I am one of the merry ones myself!"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;I don't know about that. You said
just now that Jean was acting blind; well, I
should say you were acting merry. You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
merry, for instance, when anyone is looking at
you."</p>

<p>The young wife did not answer, she only pointed
towards Bijou.</p>

<p>"She is one of the genuinely merry ones, at any
rate, is she not, grandmamma?"</p>

<p>Bijou had just given the children some flowers,
and was now speaking to the Abbé Courteil.</p>

<p>"And you too, monsieur, I want to decorate
you with my flowers! There, now, just tell me if
that rose is not beautiful? Ah, if you want
a lovely rose, that certainly is one."</p>

<p>She was holding out to him an enormous rose,
which was full blown, and looked like a regular
cabbage.</p>

<p>The abbé had risen from his seat without loosing
the bag containing the loto numbers. He
looked scared, and stammered out as he stepped
back:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, it is indeed a superb flower; but&mdash;but
I should not know where to put it. The
button-holes of my cassock are so small, the stalk
would never go through. I am very much obliged,
mademoiselle, I really am. I&mdash;but there is no
place to put it&mdash;it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but there is room for it in your girdle,"
she answered, laughing. "There, monsieur, look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
there&mdash;it is as though it had been made for
it!"</p>

<p>Standing at some little distance away, she
pushed the long stalk of the flower between the
abbé's girdle and cassock.</p>

<p>He thanked her as he bowed awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged, mademoiselle, it is very
kind of you; I am quite touched&mdash;quite touched."</p>

<p>At every movement the rose swung about in the
loose girdle. It moved backwards and forwards in
the most comical way, with ridiculous little jerks,
showing up to advantage against the cassock which
was all twisted like a screw round the abbé's thin
body.</p>

<p>"Now, I am going to arrange my vases,"
remarked Bijou, when she had adorned everyone
with flowers.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked M. de Rueille.</p>

<p>"Why, in the dining-room, in the drawing-room,
in the hall, here, everywhere."</p>

<p>"We will come and help you!" exclaimed several
voices.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!&mdash;instead of helping me you would just
hinder me."</p>

<p>She picked up her basket and went away, looking
very merry and fresh. Her muslin dress
fluttered round her, as pink and pretty as she herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was. As soon as she had disappeared, it
seemed as though a veil of melancholy had
suddenly spread itself over the large room. No
one spoke, and there was not a sound to be heard
except the knocking together of the billiard-balls,
and the rattling of the numbers, which the abbé
kept shaking all the time, bringing into this game,
as into everything else, the methodical precision
which was habitual to him.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma," said Henry de Bracieux at
length, "you ought not to allow Bijou to give us
the slip like this, especially at Bracieux. In Paris
it is not so bad, but here, when she leaves us we
are done for; she is the ray of sunshine that lights
up the whole house."</p>

<p>The marchioness shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You talk nonsense; you forget that very soon
Bijou will <i>give us the slip</i>, as you so elegantly put
it, in a more decisive way."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? She is not going to be
married?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so."</p>

<p>"You have someone in view?" asked M. de
Rueille, not very well pleased.</p>

<p>"No, not at all; but, you see, the said someone
may present himself one day or another&mdash;not
here, of course, there is no one round here who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
would be suitable for Bijou; but it is very probable
that this winter in Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>Henry de Bracieux, a fine-looking young man
of twenty-five years of age, with a strong resemblance
to his sister Bertrade, was listening to the
words of the marchioness. His eyebrows were
knitted, and there was a serious expression on his
face. He missed a very easy cannon, and his
brother-in-law was astonished.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it!" he exclaimed; "it is too warm to
play billiards. I am going out to have a nap
in the hammock."</p>

<p>His sister watched him as he left the room,
and then turning towards the marchioness, she
whispered:</p>

<p>"He, too!"</p>

<p>The old lady replied, with a touch of ill-humour:</p>

<p>"Bijou cannot marry all the family, anyhow.
Ah! here she is, we must not talk about it."</p>

<p>Just at that moment the graceful figure of the
young girl appeared in the doorway leading to
the stone steps.</p>

<p>"How many people will there be to dinner on
Thursday, grandmamma?" she asked, without
entering the room.</p>

<p>"Why, I have not counted. There are the La
Balues&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"That makes four."</p>

<p>"The Juzencourts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Six."</p>

<p>"Young Bernès&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seven."</p>

<p>"Madame de Nézel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eight."</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"And we are ten to start with, that makes
eighteen. We can do with twenty; will you invite
the Dubuissons, grandmamma? I should so
like to have Jeanne."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly willing. I will write to them."</p>

<p>"It isn't worth while. I shall have to go to
Pont-sur-Loire to get things in, and I can invite
them."</p>

<p>"My poor dear child! you are going to the
town through this heat?"</p>

<p>"We <i>must</i> see about the things for this dinner.
To-day is Tuesday&mdash;and then I want to speak to
Mère Rafut, and see if she can come to work. I
have no dresses to put on, and there will be the
races, and some dances."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the marchioness, evidently annoyed,
"you are going to have that frightful old woman
again."</p>

<p>"Why, grandmamma, she's a very nice, straightforward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sort of woman, and then she works so
well."</p>

<p>"That may be; but her appearance is terribly
against her."</p>

<p>"Yes, grandmamma, that is so, she is not
beautiful&mdash;Mère Rafut is old and poor, and old
age and poverty do not improve the appearance;
but it is so convenient for me to have her; and
she is so happy to come here, and be well-paid,
and well-fed, and well-treated, after being accustomed
to her actresses, who either pay her badly
or not at all."</p>

<p>By this time Bijou was standing just behind
Madame de Bracieux's arm-chair. She added in
a coaxing way, as she threw her pretty pink arms
around the old lady's neck:</p>

<p>"It is quite a charity, grandmamma; and a
charity not only to Mère Rafut, but to me."</p>

<p>"Have her then," answered the marchioness,
"have your frightful old woman&mdash;let her come as
much as you like!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, good-bye for the present."</p>

<p>"How are you going?&mdash;in the victoria?"</p>

<p>"No, in the trap; I shall be quicker if I take
the trap&mdash;I can go there in twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i> are going to drive?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, grandmamma."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"And with the sun so hot? You'll have a
stroke."</p>

<p>"Shall I drive you, Bijou?" proposed M. de
Rueille. "I want to get some tobacco, and some
powder, and two fishing-rods to replace those that
Pierrot broke. I shall be glad to go to town."</p>

<p>"And I shall be delighted for you to drive me."</p>

<p>"When shall we start?"</p>

<p>"At once, please."</p>

<p>Just as they were going out of the room, the
marchioness called out to them:</p>

<p>"Beware of accidents. Don't go too quickly
downhill."</p>

<p>"You can be quite easy, grandmamma, I never
lose my head."</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the evening as they were driving through Pont-sur-Loire
on their way back to Bracieux, M. de
Rueille said to Denyse:</p>

<p>"There is no mistake about it, Bijou, my dear
with you there is no chance of passing by unnoticed.
Oh, dear, no!"</p>

<p>She glanced at the foot-passengers, who were
turning round to look at her with intense curiosity,
and answered:</p>

<p>"It's my pink dress that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it is not your dress, it is you yourself."</p>

<p>Her large violet eyes grew larger with astonishment
as she asked:</p>

<p>"I, myself? But why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bijou, my dear, it is not at all nice of you to
act like that with your poor old cousin."</p>

<p>"You think I am acting?" she exclaimed, looking
more and more astounded.</p>

<p>"Well, it appears like it to me; it is impossible
for you not to know how pretty you are. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
first place, you have eyes, and then you are told
often enough for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am told?&mdash;by whom?"</p>

<p>"By everyone. Why, even I, although I am
nearly your uncle and a settled-down respectable
sort of man."</p>

<p>"'Nearly my uncle.' No&mdash;considering that Bertrade
is my first cousin; and, as to the rest&mdash;"
She stopped abruptly, and then finished with a
laugh. "You flatter yourself!"</p>

<p>"Alas, no! I shall soon be forty-two."</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, well! you don't look it."</p>

<p>"Thank you! There now! Do you see how
all the natives are gazing at you? I can assure
you, Bijou, that when I come to do any shopping
alone, they do not watch me so eagerly."</p>

<p>"I tell you it is this pink dress that astonishes
them."</p>

<p>"But why should they be astonished? They are
accustomed to that, because you often come to
Pont-sur-Loire, and you always wear pink."</p>

<p>Ever since she had left off her mourning for her
parents, who had died four years ago, Denyse had
adopted pink as her only colour for all her dresses.
The reason was, she said, because her grandmother
preferred seeing her dressed thus. Anyhow, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
pink, a very pale, soft shade, like that of the petals
of a rose just as it begins to fall, suited her to perfection,
as it was almost exactly the same delicate
colour as her skin.</p>

<p>She always wore it, and when the weather was
cold or gloomy she would put on a long, gathered
cloak, which covered her entirely, and on taking
this dark wrap off, she would come out, looking as
fresh and sweet as a flower, and seem to brighten
up everything around her.</p>

<p>Her dresses were always of batiste, muslin, or
some soft woollen material, comparatively inexpensive.
The greatest luxury to which she treated
herself now and again was a <i>taffetas</i> or surah silk.
And then, nothing could be more simple than the
way these dresses were made&mdash;always the same
little gathered blouses and straight skirts, and never
any trimming whatever, except, perhaps, in the
winter, a narrow edging of fur.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's quite true," she said thoughtfully,
"I am always in pink. You don't like that?"</p>

<p>"Not like it? I&mdash;good heavens!&mdash;why, I think
it is perfectly charming! I tell you, Bijou, that if
I were not an old man, I should make love to you
all the time!"</p>

<p>"You are not an old man!"</p>

<p>"Very many thanks! If, however, you do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
look upon me as quite an old man&mdash;which, by the
bye, is certainly debatable&mdash;I am at any rate a
married man."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true, and so much the better for
you, for there is nothing more stupid and tiresome
than men who are always making love."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you must know a terrible number
of people who are stupid and tiresome."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because everyone makes love to you&mdash;more or
less!"</p>

<p>"Not at all! Why, just think! I was brought
up in the most isolated way, like a veritable
savage. When papa and mamma were living,
they were always ill, and I was shut up with them,
and never saw anyone. It is scarcely four years
since I came to live with grandmamma, where I do
see people."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; plenty of them, and no mistake!"</p>

<p>"You speak as though that annoyed you?"</p>

<p>She glanced sideways at Rueille, her eyes shining
beneath her drooping eyelids, whilst he replied,
with a touch of irritation in his voice in spite of
himself:</p>

<p>"Annoyed me, but why should it? Are your
affairs any business of mine; have I any voice in
the matter of anything that concerns you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which means that if you had a voice in the
matter&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Ah, there would certainly be many changes,
and many reforms that I should make."</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should not allow you, if I were in your
grandmamma's place, to be quite as affable and
as ready to welcome everyone; I should want
to keep you rather more for myself, and prevent
your letting strangers have so much of you."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, with a pensive expression,
"perhaps you are right."</p>

<p>"And all the more so because we shall have you
to ourselves for so short a time now."</p>

<p>The large candid eyes, with their sweet expression,
were fixed on Paul de Rueille as he continued:</p>

<p>"You will be marrying soon? You will be
leaving us?"</p>

<p>Bijou laughed. "How you arrange things.
There is no question, as far as I know, of my
marriage."</p>

<p>"There is nothing definite&mdash;no; at least, I do
not think so. But, practically, it is the one
subject in question, and grandmamma thinks of
nothing else."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I am not like her then, for I scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
ever give it a thought." And then she added,
turning grave all at once: "Besides, my marriage
is very problematical."</p>

<p>"Problematical?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes,&mdash;in the first place, I should want the
man who marries me to love me."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you can be easy on that score; you
will have no difficulty about that."</p>

<p>Her fresh young voice took an almost solemn
tone as she continued:</p>

<p>"And then I should want to love him,
too."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you will. One always does love one's
husband&mdash;to begin with," said Rueille carelessly;
and then he stopped short, thinking that the words
"to begin with" were unnecessary.</p>

<p>Bijou had not understood, however, nor even
heard, for she asked:</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I said that he will be very happy."</p>

<p>"Who will be happy?"</p>

<p>"The man you love!"</p>

<p>"I hope so. I shall do all I can for that!"</p>

<p>M. de Rueille seemed to be annoyed and irritated.
He said, in a disagreeable way, as though
he wanted to discourage Denyse in her dreams of
the future:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but supposing you do not happen to meet
with him?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, I shall die an old maid, that's all!
But I do not see why I should not meet with him.
I do not ask for anything impossible, after all!"</p>

<p>In a mocking tone, and a trifle aggressive, he,
asked:</p>

<p>"Would it be very indiscreet to ask you what
you expect?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not indiscreet in the slightest degree, for I
can only answer just as I have already answered,
I should simply want <i>to love him</i>! I do not care
at all about money; I neither understand money
nor worship it!" She turned towards her cousin,
and said, in conclusion, as she looked up into his
face: "Now, I'll tell you, I would agree to a
marriage like Bertrade's."</p>

<p>"With another husband," he stammered out.</p>

<p>Very simply and naturally, and without the
slightest embarrassment, she said, laughing:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no! No, I think the husband is
quite nice."</p>

<p>M. de Rueille did not answer. He could not
help feeling some emotion, in spite of himself, at
this idea that Bijou might have cared for him. It
seemed to him that the evening air was delicious,
and never had the setting sun, which was sinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
slowly like a ball of flame into the Loire, appeared
more brilliant to him. The little gig was so
narrow, that, with every oscillation, his elbow
touched the young girl's arm, whilst her soft fair
hair, escaping from her large straw hat, kept brushing
against his cheek, which began to burn.</p>

<p>Bijou noticed his absent-mindedness.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," she said, laughing, "that you
are not listening much to the description of my
ideal."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!&mdash;by the bye, have we done all the
errands?"</p>

<p>She took out of her pocket a long list, which she
began to read:</p>

<p>"<i>Ice. Cakes. Fruit. Fish. The Dubuissons.
Speak to the butcher. Pink gauze. Mère Rafut.
Hat. Pierrot's books. Henry's cartridges (16).</i>"</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked M. de Rueille, who was
looking at the list. "Henry has commissioned
you to get his cartridges instead of telling me to
get them?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the time before last when he asked you,
you forgot them; and last time you brought him
number twelve cartridges, and his are number sixteen;
therefore, he preferred&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! I can understand that; but they do take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
advantage of you&mdash;and the children too have taken
advantage. '<i>Balloon for Marcel, pencils for Robert</i>;'
Fred is the only one who has not given you any
commissions. You need not despair though, he
is only three years old; he will begin next
year."</p>

<p>"He did not give me any commissions, but I have
brought him a picture book&mdash;'Puss in Boots.' He
adores cats, so that will amuse him."</p>

<p>"How delicious you are!"</p>

<p>"Delicious! Is that saying enough? Could
you not find something rather more eulogistic?
Let us see&mdash;try now!"</p>

<p>She was still glancing down the list; and Paul
de Rueille pointed with the handle of his whip to
a line written in pencil:</p>

<p>"What's that?&mdash;'<i>Tell grandmamma about La
Norinière!</i>'"</p>

<p>"Why, I met the Juzencourts, and they said I
was to be sure to tell grandmamma that 'The
Norinière' is to be inhabited."</p>

<p>"Ah, Clagny has sold it?"</p>

<p>"No; he is coming back to it. It appears that
he is coming every summer."</p>

<p>"Ah, so much the better. Grandmamma will
be very glad of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, she likes him very much. I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
him, this M. de Clagny, but I have often heard
about him."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember seeing him a long time
ago?"</p>

<p>"Why, no!"</p>

<p>"Well, he was your godfather, anyhow!"</p>

<p>"You are dreaming! Uncle Alexis is my godfather."</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Jonzac is the godfather of Denyse,
but it was M. de Clagny who was the godfather of
Bijou. Yes, he said once, speaking of you when
you were very little, <i>the Bijou</i>&mdash;and the name
suited you so well that you have had it ever
since."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is rather ridiculous to call
me Bijou now that I am old?"</p>

<p>"You look as though you were fourteen, and
you always will look like that, I promise you."</p>

<p>"Isn't it rather risky to promise me that?"</p>

<p>She laughed as she glanced at him, and he, too,
looked at her as though he could not take his eyes
away from the pretty, fresh young face turned
towards him. He was paying no attention to
the road, which was in a very bad state, until
suddenly the right wheel went into a rut, and the
gig gave a jerk, which sent Denyse on to him. She
clung to his arm with all her might, and they remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
an instant like this until they were able to
regain their balance. The wheel, then, in some
way or another, got clear of the deep rut in which
it had been caught, and the horse went on again at
a quick pace as before.</p>

<p>"That's right!" said Bijou, laughing heartily.
"I certainly thought we should be upset."</p>

<p>"It was as near a shave as possible," he answered
gravely.</p>

<p>She loosened the grasp of her small fingers,
which had been pressed tightly on her cousin's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Is it really over?" she asked. "You are not
going to begin again, I hope?"</p>

<p>M. de Rueille did not answer. He was looking
at her with an absent-minded, troubled expression
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes; but, instead of looking at me, do look
before you," she went on. "We shall get into
another rut directly, you'll see."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! oh, no!" he murmured, as though he
were in some dream.</p>

<p>"I'm sure we shall be late for dinner," said
Bijou; "and you know grandmamma does not
altogether like that."</p>

<p>Rueille touched the pony's back with the whip,
and the animal, springing forward, jerked the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
carriage violently, and then started off at a mad
pace.</p>

<p>This time Bijou looked stupefied.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" she asked. "Whatever is
the matter with you to-day? Just now you
almost upset us, and now you touch Colonel with
the whip, and you ought not to let him even guess
that you have one; you have made him take
fright," and then, seeing that the horse was calming
down, she added, "or nearly so; you are not yourself
at all."</p>

<p>"No," he answered mechanically, "I am not
myself."</p>

<p>At the pony's first plunge Denyse had taken
M. de Rueille's arm again. It was not that she
was in the least afraid, but she was perched on a
seat which was too high for her, so that she could
not keep her balance, and, consequently, she tried
to hold on to something firm. Without loosing
the arm on to which she was hanging, she leant
towards her cousin, and asked, with evident interest:</p>

<p>"Not yourself? What is the matter? Are you
ill?"</p>

<p>"Ill? No! at least, not exactly."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by <i>not exactly</i>? Oh, but
you must not be ill. We have to work at our
play this evening, and if you do not set about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
all of you, and in earnest, why, it will never be
finished for the race-ball."</p>

<p>"I don't care a hang about the play, and&mdash;I&mdash;if
I were you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, evidently embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Bijou, "what is it? You were
going to say something."</p>

<p>"Yes," he stammered out, scarcely knowing how
to put what he wanted to say. "I was going to
remark that the design Jean has made for your&mdash;for
Hebe's dress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't the thing at all; there is too
little of it."</p>

<p>"Too little of it? Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"It isn't nonsense. I say it is not the thing for
a woman, and especially a young girl like you, to
appear like that."</p>

<p>Bijou looked at Paul de Rueille with a bewildered
expression on her face, and then burst
out laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are queer; you look exactly like a
jealous husband."</p>

<p>"Jealous!" he stammered out, vexed and ill at
ease. "It isn't for me to be jealous, but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, certainly, but all the same, without being
jealous, you men do not like a woman to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pretty, or to be nice, or amusing, for anyone else's
benefit than just your own."</p>

<p>"Well, admitting that that is so, it is quite
natural."</p>

<p>"Ah! you think so? Oh, well, a woman, on
the contrary, is always glad when the men she likes
are admired; she is delighted when other people
like them too."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You do not know anything about
it, my dear Bijou. You are most deliciously inexperienced
in such things fortunately."</p>

<p>"Why <i>fortunately</i>?" she asked, opening her
soft, innocent eyes wide in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short, and Bijou insisted, pinching
his arm.</p>

<p>"Well, go on&mdash;do go on."</p>

<p>"No, it would be too complicated," he answered,
evidently ill at ease, and trying to shake off the
grasp of the strong little hand.</p>

<p>"Too complicated!" repeated Bijou, turning red.
"I detest being put off like that. Why will you
not explain what you were thinking?"</p>

<p>"Explain what I was thinking," he said, in a
sort of fright. "Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"No? Well, it is not nice of you."</p>

<p>They went on for a minute or two without speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Bijou calm and smiling, and her companion
with a serious, uneasy look on his face.</p>

<p>Just as the gig was entering the avenue, Bijou
turned towards M. de Rueille, and touching him,
this time very gently, with her little hand, she said
in a penetrating voice, which, in his agitated state
of mind, was the last straw:</p>

<p>"As it vexes you so much I won't wear that
costume. We will get Jean to design another for
me."</p>

<p>He seized the hand that was resting on his arm
and pressed it to his lips with an almost brutal
tenderness.</p>

<p>Bijou did not appear to like this passionate display
of feeling. She drew her hand away quietly,
but there was a strange gleam in her eyes as she
said:</p>

<p>"Take care of the gate, it is a sharp turn remember,
and you are not in luck to-day."</p>

<p>She then began to collect her parcels calmly, and
until they arrived at the door of the <i>château</i> she
was silent and thoughtful. The first dinner-bell
was just ringing, and Bijou ran upstairs to her
room, and ten minutes later entered the drawing-room,
arrayed in a dainty dress of rose-leaf
coloured chiffon, with a large bunch of roses on the
shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why! you don't mean to say that you are here
already!" exclaimed Madame de Rueille admiringly.
"I will wager anything that that slow coach
of a Paul is not ready."</p>

<p>"Did you do all the commissions?" asked the
marchioness.</p>

<p>"Yes, grandmamma, and I have a special one for
you. The Juzencourts wished me to tell you that
M. de Clagny is coming back to live at The Norinière,
and that he will come every year."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Madame de Bracieux, looking
very delighted, "I am glad to hear that. I never
expected to see him come back here."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Bijou.</p>

<p>"Well, because when he was here he had a great
grief, just at an age when painful impressions can
never be effaced."</p>

<p>"At what age is that?" asked Jean de Blaye,
with a touch of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p>"Forty-eight. And when you are that age, you
will not be as fond of ridiculing everything as you
are now, my dear boy; and it won't be so long
before you get there as you think either."</p>

<p>"So much the better," he answered, smiling;
"that must be the ideal age&mdash;the age when one's
heart is at rest."</p>

<p>"In some cases it is at rest before that age,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
said the marchioness slily, looking at her
nephew.</p>

<p>Jean shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it wakes up again, or, at least, it might
wake up; one is not quite easy about it; but at
forty-eight ..."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's your opinion. Well, it is twelve years
ago now since my old friend Clagny was forty-eight.
He must therefore be sixty at present, and
I would wager anything that his heart has never
been at rest&mdash;never. You understand me?" And
then in a lower tone, so that Bijou, who was just
talking to Bertrade, should not hear, she added:
"Neither his heart nor he himself."</p>

<p>Jean laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, well! he's a curiosity this friend of yours.
Why does he not go about in a show? He would
get some money."</p>

<p>"He has no need of money."</p>

<p>"He is rich, then?"</p>

<p>"Atrociously rich!"</p>

<p>"Well, but what's he got?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen thousand a year. Don't you consider
that a fair amount?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, without any sign of enthusiasm,
"yes, of course, that's very fair&mdash;for anyone
who has not got it dishonestly." And then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
after a pause, he asked: "What was this great
trouble that he had?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll tell you about it when Bijou is not here."</p>

<p>The young girl, however, could scarcely have
heard what they were saying. She was joking
with Pierrot, who had just come into the room.
She wanted to part his hair again, and Pierrot, a
tall youth of seventeen, strong-looking, but overgrown,
with long feet and hands, and a forehead
covered with extraordinary bumps, was trying to
make himself short, so that the young girl might
reach up to his bushy, colourless hair. He was
bending his head, and looking straight before him,
with a far-away expression in his eyes, evidently
enjoying having his hair stroked by the skilful
little hands.</p>

<p>Madame de Bracieux, seeing that Bijou was at a
safe distance, ventured in a low voice to tell her
nephew the details about the love-affair, which had
in a way changed the whole life of her friend,
M. de Clagny.</p>

<p>Suddenly Denyse came across to the marchioness.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma&mdash;I forgot&mdash;the Dubuissons cannot
come to dinner on Thursday, but M. Dubuisson
will bring Jeanne on Friday, and leave her with us
for a week."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, we shall only be eighteen to
dinner."</p>

<p>"No, we shall be twenty all the same; because
I saw the Tourvilles, and I gave them an invitation
from you; I thought that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did quite right."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Bertrade, "the Tourvilles and
the Juzencourts at the same time! We shall be
sure, then, of hearing their stories of William the
Conqueror and Charles the Bold!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" exclaimed Bijou, laughing, "it will
be much better like that, we shall have it altogether,
once for all, at any rate."</p>

<p>Just as dinner was announced, M. de Rueille
entered the room. He had an absent-minded look,
and his eyes shone strangely. He took his seat
silently at table, and did not talk during the
meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bijou</span>, assisted by Pierrot, was handing the coffee
round, when suddenly she darted off in pursuit of
Paul de Rueille, who had just come out of the
drawing-room, and was descending the steps which
led on to the terrace.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop! Where are you going?" she called
out.</p>

<p>"Oh, only for a stroll," he answered, without
looking round, "to get a breath of air, if that is
possible with this heat."</p>

<p>Bijou had already caught him up.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, what about the play?&mdash;You must come
and work."</p>

<p>"My head aches."</p>

<p>"Work will take it away! You really must
come, we have only three days."</p>

<p>"But I am not indispensable; you can do
without me," said Rueille irritably.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you always do the writing."</p>

<p>"From dictation; it is not necessary to be very
clever for that."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes it is; and then, too, we are used to you."</p>

<p>She was on the step above him, and, bending
forward, she put her arms round his neck, and said
in a coaxing tone:</p>

<p>"Paul, dear, come now, just to please me, you
would be so nice, so very nice!"</p>

<p>M. de Rueille, turning abruptly, unclasped the
soft arms, which encircled his neck and rested
against his face.</p>

<p>"All right, all right!" he said, in a hoarse voice,
"I'll come!"</p>

<p>The young girl stepped back, and in the evening-light
he could see her large astonished eyes shining
as she gazed at him.</p>

<p>"How cross you are!" she said timidly. "What's
the matter with you?" He did not answer, and
she asked again: "Won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said curtly, and then he re-mounted
the steps and went into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Bijou followed him, and whispered to Bertrade:</p>

<p>"I don't know what is the matter with your
husband, but he is very bad-tempered."</p>

<p>Madame de Rueille glanced at Paul. He looked
rather fagged and nervous, and was trying to
appear at his ease, as he talked and laughed noisily
with the tutor, who, on the contrary, was silent and
reserved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, certainly something is the matter with
him," said Bertrade, rather uneasy at seeing her
husband so strange. "I do not know at all what
it is, though," she added.</p>

<p>"Only imagine," Bijou proceeded to explain to
the whole room, "Paul wanted to go for a stroll
instead of coming to work. Yes, and it was not
very easy to get him here, I can assure you."</p>

<p>With a resigned look, M. de Rueille took his
seat at a side table with a marble top. He
then took up the manuscript, and, turning to the
page which was commenced, dipped a long, quill
pen into the ink.</p>

<p>"When you are ready?"&mdash;he said calmly.</p>

<p>"Well, but first of all, where are we?" asked M.
de Jonzac.</p>

<p>"Scene three of the second act."</p>

<p>"Still?" exclaimed Bijou, astonished.</p>

<p>"Alas, yes."</p>

<p>"My dear children, you will never have it
finished," remarked the marchioness.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, grandmamma, we shall," said Bijou
merrily; "you will see how we are going to work
now. Come now, we are at the third scene of the
second act,&mdash;it is where the poet is defending himself
after the accusations&mdash;rather spiteful ones, too&mdash;which
Venus has brought against him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, and what then?" asked M. de Rueille
after a pause.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bijou, "in my opinion, we want a
little couplet there; what do you think, Jean?"</p>

<p>Jean de Blaye, with an absorbed look on his face,
was lounging in a deep arm-chair, his head thrown
back on the cushions. He appeared to be in a
reverie, and had not even heard the question.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep?" asked Bijou.</p>

<p>"Did you speak to me?" he asked, turning towards
her.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I did have the honour of speaking
to you. I asked you whether a couplet would not
be the right thing there&mdash;a couplet that would go
to some well-known air?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, in an absent sort of way, "that
would do very well."</p>

<p>"All right, compose it then."</p>

<p>Jean gave a start; he was quite roused now.</p>

<p>"I am to compose it,&mdash;why should I be the
one to do it?"</p>

<p>"Because you always do them."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a nice reason," protested Jean. "I
should say that is precisely why it is someone else's
turn. You have only to set the others to work&mdash;Henry,
or Uncle Alexis, or M. Giraud, or even
Pierrot."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you say <i>even</i>?" asked Pierrot, annoyed.
"I should do them quite as well as you."</p>

<p>"Well, do them then! for my part, I have had
enough of it."</p>

<p>"Jean," said Bijou, in a pleading tone, "don't
leave us in the lurch, please."</p>

<p>She was going across to him, her pretty head
bent forward, and a most comically beseeching
little pout on her lips, when M. de Rueille rose
abruptly from his seat, and stopped her on the
way:</p>

<p>"Oh, he will do your couplets right enough;
he likes doing them; sit down, Bijou."</p>

<p>The young girl stood still in the middle of
the room, surprised at this extraordinary proceeding.</p>

<p>"But why don't <i>you</i> sit down?" she exclaimed.
"What have you come away from your table
for?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I have no right to leave the table without
your permission?"</p>

<p>"Jean!" began Bijou again, "come now, Jean!"</p>

<p>Once again M. de Rueille interposed.</p>

<p>"Why don't you kneel down to him at once?"
he said, in a sharp tone.</p>

<p>"Goodness! I don't mind doing that even if
he will only be persuaded."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>She was darting across to her cousin, but Rueille
caught her arm, and said angrily:</p>

<p>"What nonsense! it is perfectly ridiculous!"</p>

<p>Bijou looked at him in amazement, and stammered
out:</p>

<p>"It is you who are ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," he answered, speaking
harshly, "it is I who ought to go and sit down,
and I am the one who is ridiculous; in fact, I am
everything I ought not to be, and I always do
everything I ought not to do."</p>

<p>"Whatever is the matter, children?" asked
Madame de Bracieux.</p>

<p>M. de Jonzac explained, as he emptied his
pipe by tapping it gently against a piece of furniture.</p>

<p>"Heaven have mercy upon us! It is nothing
less than Paul quarrelling with Bijou!"</p>

<p>"With Bijou?" exclaimed the old lady, in perfect
amazement.</p>

<p>"Paul quarrelling with Bijou!" repeated Madame
de Rueille, putting down the newspaper she had
been reading, "impossible!"</p>

<p>"Yes, really!" affirmed the abbé, quite horrified.
"M. de Rueille is vexed with Mademoiselle
Denyse!"</p>

<p>"Come here, Bijou!" called out the marchioness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and the young girl tripped across the room to her
grandmamma, and knelt down on the cushions at
her feet.</p>

<p>"You ought not to let Bijou go on in that way
with you!" said M. de Rueille, going up to Jean,
and speaking in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Go on in what way? are you dreaming?"</p>

<p>"I am not dreaming at all. Denyse is twenty
years old, you know!"</p>

<p>"Twenty-one," corrected the young man.</p>

<p>"All the more reason&mdash;she really ought to
behave more carefully!"</p>

<p>"Poor child, she behaves perfectly!" and then
looking at his cousin, he added: "I really don't
know what's up with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm in the wrong," murmured M. de
Rueille, slightly embarrassed. "Of course, I'm
quite in the wrong!"</p>

<p>"Absolutely so!" said Blaye drily, getting up
from his arm-chair.</p>

<p>On seeing him move towards the door, Bijou
left the marchioness, and rushed across to him:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! you are not going away! Grandmamma,
tell him that he is not to leave us like
this!"</p>

<p>"Come now, Jean," said the marchioness, half
joking and half scolding, "don't plague them so!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man sat down again in despair.</p>

<p>"And this is the country!" he exclaimed,
"this is rest and holiday! I have to work like
a nigger, writing plays&mdash;plays with couplets&mdash;and
then go to bed regularly at two in the
morning, and this is what is called being in
clover!"</p>

<p>Pierrot had listened to this outburst with apparent
solemnity.</p>

<p>"Continue, old man," he said jeeringly, "you
interest me!"</p>

<p>Bijou laughed, and Jean, looking annoyed, turned
towards Pierrot, and said sarcastically, "You are
very witty, my dear boy!"</p>

<p>"Children, you are perfectly insufferable!" exclaimed
Madame de Bracieux, raising her voice.
She was looking at them in surprise, wondering
what wind had suddenly risen to bring about this
storm. She could not account for all these disagreeable
little speeches, and the hostile attitude
they had taken up, and which was quite a new
thing to the old lady. Once again she called Bijou
to her. The young girl was standing looking round
at everyone with a questioning expression in her
soft eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you know what's the matter with them?"
asked the marchioness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no idea, grandmamma," she answered
innocently, the wondering look still on her
face.</p>

<p>"Don't you see how cross they are?" continued
the marchioness.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can see that they are cross, but I do not
know what it's all about; if it is on account of the
play, why, we won't have it! I don't want to worry
everyone with it, just because I like it; but I <i>do</i> like
it immensely."</p>

<p>Just at this moment M. de Rueille called
out:</p>

<p>"Well, are we going to work at this, yes or no?
I have had enough of sitting waiting here like an
imbecile."</p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked Jean, in a way which
meant, "As there's no getting out of it, let us start
at once."</p>

<p>"We've told you where we are&mdash;" answered
Rueille, "we've told you twice."</p>

<p>Bijou interposed, explaining in a conciliatory
tone:</p>

<p>"It is where the poet has to answer Venus."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! exactly, I remember! She has
accused him of all sorts of things, and you want
him to defend himself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In a couplet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I understand&mdash;where are you going
though?"</p>

<p>Bijou was just crossing the room.</p>

<p>"I am going across to sit by M. Giraud; he won't
worry me like all of you."</p>

<p>The tutor blushed, and moved slightly to make
room for her on the divan on which he was seated.
Denyse glided on, and took her place at his side.</p>

<p>"We are listening," she said.</p>

<p>Jean was twisting a pencil and a piece of paper
about in his fingers.</p>

<p>"What did Venus answer?" he asked.</p>

<p>M. de Rueille, with an absent-minded expression
on his face, was watching a moth fluttering round
the lamp near him.</p>

<p>"What did Venus answer?" called out several
voices together, as loudly as possible.</p>

<p>M. de Rueille looked aghast, and, stopping his
ears, read aloud from the manuscript:</p>

<p>"'<i>You know I do not believe a word of it.</i>'"</p>

<p>"Strike that out," said Jean, "and put: '<i>I do not
believe it at all, you know.</i>' And now the poet
answers:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>L'âme d'un symboliste,</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Madame, est un coffret mélancolique d'améthyste</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>A serrure de diamant.</i></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Il suffit de savoir l'ouvrir et la comprendre</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Et le trésor éclos illumine la chambre</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Et sourit la tristesse aux lèvres des amants.</i>'"</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"Is that at all amusing?" asked M. de Rueille.</p>

<p>"Well, hang it all!" exclaimed Jean irritably,
"I do not say that it is precisely a <i>chef-d'&#339;uvre</i>!
Bijou asked for a couplet&mdash;I have given her a
couplet to the best of my ability, but I don't wish
to hinder you from giving us a better one."</p>

<p>"To what air will that go?" asked Bijou.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, that's true, we want an air for it. What
is there?"</p>

<p>"You might put '<i>Air. J'en guette un petit de mon
âge</i>,'" suggested Rueille.</p>

<p>"Does that go to it?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'does it go to it?'"</p>

<p>"Why, that air."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't even know what the air is."</p>

<p>"Then why do you suggest that we should take
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! because I often see things to that air:
'<i>J'en guette un petit de mon âge.</i>' I just remembered
seeing it, and there are lots of couplets that are put
to it."</p>

<p>"But the poet's lines are longer than that,"
remarked Bijou, "especially the second one. No&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
could never sing them to that air&mdash;nor to any
other."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!&mdash;I did not think of that."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, Bijou thinks of everything," put in
Pierrot, with pride.</p>

<p>"We'll find an air for it presently," said Jean.
"Let's go on; do let's go on, or we never shall finish
it. Who's on the stage at present?"</p>

<p>And then, as M. de Rueille was biting the end of
his pen and watching Bijou, so that he did not
appear to have heard, Blaye exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Paul, are you there? or have you gone out for
a time?"</p>

<p>"I am there."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well! then will you have the kindness
to tell me which of the characters are at present
on the scene?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! I'll just look."</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Bijou, "do you mean to
say you have to look before you can tell us?"</p>

<p>"Well, you do not imagine, I presume, that I
know by heart all the insane things that each of
you has been pleased to dictate to me."</p>

<p>"I know them all anyhow," and then, turning
towards Jean de Blaye, she answered his question.
"We have on the scene at present, Venus, the
Poet, Thomas Vireloque, and the Opportunist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and we said yesterday that after the introduction
of the Poet to Venus, we would let
Madame de Staël come in."</p>

<p>"Very well, we will let her enter at once."</p>

<p>"Have you found anyone for Madame de
Staël?" asked Rueille; "up to the present no one
has wanted to act her part."</p>

<p>"No," said Bijou; "just now I asked Madame
de Juzencourt again, but she refuses energetically;
and if Bertrade refuses too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bertrade refuses absolutely," replied the young
wife, very gently.</p>

<p>"It isn't nice of you."</p>

<p>"Is Madame de Staël indispensable?" asked
Uncle Jonzac.</p>

<p>"Quite indispensable," answered Bijou, emphatically.
"We must absolutely find some way of&mdash;" And
then suddenly breaking off, as a new idea
struck her, she exclaimed gaily: "Why, Henry
can take it&mdash;Madame de Staël's <i>rôle</i>; he has
scarcely any moustache."</p>

<p>"I?" cried Bracieux. "<i>I</i> act Madame de
Staël?"</p>

<p>"She was rather masculine; it will do very
well."</p>

<p>"But, good heavens!&mdash;I am not going to appear
before people I know arrayed in a low-necked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
dress, a turban, and all padded up&mdash;why, it would
be frightful!"</p>

<p>"Not at all! Oh, come now&mdash;you don't want
pressing, I hope?"</p>

<p>"And you are not going to spoil the whole
thing by being disobliging over it," added Pierrot,
with a virtuous air.</p>

<p>"Disobliging?" exclaimed Henry, turning towards
him; "it is very evident that you are not
in my place. By the bye, though, you might very
well be in my place;" and then seeing that Pierrot
looked horror-stricken, he continued: "Why
shouldn't you take it instead of me&mdash;you have
less moustache even than I have!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am too scraggy," declared Pierrot
cunningly. "Madame de Staël was rather a stout-looking
woman."</p>

<p>"Scraggy? you, the athlete!"</p>

<p>Jean de Blaye knocked the floor with a billiard-cue
for silence.</p>

<p>"We will think about who is to act Madame
de Staël when we have found out what she has to
say&mdash;Well, then, she enters&mdash;Are you not going
to write, Paul?"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to write?"</p>

<p>"Well, just write:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> '<i>Madame de Staël enters
by</i>&mdash;' Yes, but that's the point&mdash;by which door
does she enter?"</p>

<p>"I have put '<i>from the back of stage.</i>' Whenever
you don't tell me how they come in, I always put
'<i>from the back of stage.</i>'"</p>

<p>"All right! Then we will leave '<i>from the back
of the stage.</i>'"<br /><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Madame de Staël (to Thomas Vireloque)</i>: 'I am
Madame de Staël.'</p>

<p><i>Thomas Vireloque</i>: 'Beg pardon?'</p>

<p><i>Madame de Staël</i>: 'I am Madame de Staël.'</p>

<p><i>Venus</i>: 'What have you to tell us?'</p>

<p><i>The Opportunist</i>: 'It is very curious&mdash;I took
you for a Turk.'</p>

<p><i>The Poet</i>: 'And I&mdash;'"
<br /><br /><br /></p></blockquote>

<p>"Wait a minute!" said M. de Rueille, "I've
made a mistake."</p>

<p>"How could you?"</p>

<p>"How could I? The same way we generally
do make mistakes, of course&mdash;I wasn't thinking."</p>

<p>"That's about it," said Bijou. "I don't know
what's the matter with you, but you certainly are
absent-minded this evening."</p>

<p>Without answering, Rueille drew his quill-pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
across the paper, bearing on heavily, so that the
pen gave a plaintive screech.</p>

<p>"What are you doing now?" asked Jean.</p>

<p>"I am crossing it out."</p>

<p>"What are you crossing out?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had written the same sentences over
four times each."</p>

<p>Bijou and Blaye got up to examine M. de
Rueille's work, and the young girl read out:<br /><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Madame de Staël</i>: 'I am Madame de Staël.'</p>

<p><i>Thomas Vireloque</i>: 'Beg pardon?'</p>

<p><i>Madame de Staël</i>; 'I am Madame de Staël.'</p>

<p><i>Thomas Vireloque</i>: 'Beg pardon?'</p>

<p><i>Madame de Staël</i>; 'I am Madame de Staël.'"
<br /><br /><br /></p></blockquote>


<p>"Oh, yes," said Bijou, "you must cross that
out!"</p>

<p>"No, leave it as it is, on the contrary," protested
Jean, laughing; "they'll think that Mæterlinck
collaborated with us&mdash;it will be capital."</p>

<p>"Supposing we were to retire," proposed M. de
Jonzac. "Paul is half-asleep, that's why he wrote
the same thing over three times without noticing
it. Abbé Courteil is fast asleep, and, as for me,
I am dying to follow his example."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bijou, "it is scarcely one o'clock."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, but it seems to me that in the country&mdash;What
do you say about the matter, Monsieur
Giraud?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as for me, monsieur, I could sit up all
night without feeling sleepy," replied the young
tutor, without taking his eyes off Bijou.</p>

<p>"My dear children," said the marchioness, getting
up, "your uncle is quite right, you must go to
bed. Bijou, will you see that the books you had
out of the library are put back?"</p>

<p>"Yes grandmamma, I will put them back myself."</p>

<p>When the others had gone upstairs, M. de Rueille
asked:</p>

<p>"Shall I help you, Bijou? two will do it more
quickly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you don't know anything about the library;
you would mix them all up. I must have someone
who knows where the books go." And then
turning towards the tutor, who was just going out
of the room, she said to him, in the most charming
way, as though to excuse the liberty she was
taking: "Monsieur Giraud, would <i>you</i> help me
to put the books up?"</p>

<p>The young man stopped short, too delighted
even for words. As he remained standing there,
she pointed to the open door leading into the hall
and said gently:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you shut the door, please? And then, if
you will take Molière, I will bring Aristophanes,
and we will come back for the others&mdash;yes, that's
it."</p>

<p>As she tripped along with the books, she chattered
away, not as though she were addressing her
companion, but rather as though she were going on
with her thoughts aloud.</p>

<p>"What was Jean looking for in Aristophanes
when he only wanted to make Thomas Vireloque
and Madame de Staël talk?" And then breaking
off abruptly, she asked:</p>

<p>"Do you think it will be interesting&mdash;our play?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Why do you never help us? you ought to
work at it, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not very well up in that sort of thing,
mademoiselle; politics and society talk are like
sealed books to me, and I do not exactly see
either&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then, probably, you would rather be just a
spectator?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, mademoiselle, to my great regret,
I shall not even be that."</p>

<p>"What?" she exclaimed, in amazement, "you
will not see our play?"</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, why?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" he replied, dreadfully embarrassed, "for a
very ridiculous reason."</p>

<p>"But what is it?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do please tell me why?" she said, and as she
leaned forward towards him, looking so graceful
and charming, the perfume from her hair plunged
the young man into a sort of enervating torpor.</p>

<p>"Why will you not tell me?" she said at length,
almost sadly; "don't you look upon me a little as
your friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle," he stammered out, "I&mdash;I
cannot appear at this soiree because&mdash;you will see
how prosaic my reason is&mdash;the fact is, I have not a
dress-coat."</p>

<p>"But you have plenty of time to send for your
dress-coat; besides, you will want it for Thursday,
there is a dinner on Thursday."</p>

<p>Giraud blushed crimson.</p>

<p>"But, mademoiselle, I cannot send for it either
for Thursday or for later on, because I&mdash;I haven't
one."</p>

<p>"Not at all?"</p>

<p>"Not at all!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are joking?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not joking, mademoiselle! I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
not possess a dress-coat." And then he added with
a smile which was quite pathetic: "And there are
plenty of poor wretches like I am who are in the
same predicament!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bijou, taking the tutor's hand with
an abrupt movement, "do forgive me&mdash;how horrid
and thoughtless I am! You will detest me,
shall you not?"</p>

<p>She pressed his hand slowly in a way which
sent a thrill through him.</p>

<p>"Detest you?" he stammered out, almost beside
himself with joy. "I adore you!&mdash;I simply adore
you!"</p>

<p>Bijou gazed at him in a startled way, but there
was a tender expression in her eyes, which were
dimmed with tears. Her voice was quite changed
when she spoke again:</p>

<p>"Go away now!" she said, "and do not say
that again; you must never, never say it again!"</p>

<p>When he reached the door he turned round, and
saw that Bijou had thrown herself down on the
divan, and was sobbing, with her face buried in the
cushions. He wanted to go back to her, but he
did not dare, and, without saying another word, he
left the room.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bijou</span>, who, as a rule, was to be seen every morning
trotting about, either in the house or the park,
did not appear until after the first luncheon-bell.</p>

<p>Pierrot, who had been quite uneasy, rushed
across to meet her, and assailed her with questions
before she had had time to say good-morning to
the marchioness and to her Uncle Alexis.</p>

<p>He wanted to know why he had not seen her
as usual in the dairy, where she always went every
morning to inspect the cheeses. Why had she
not been there, as she had not been out riding?</p>

<p>"How do you know that I have not been out
riding?" asked Bijou.</p>

<p>"Because Patatras was in the stable," replied
Pierrot. "I went to see."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you keep a watch on me?" she said,
laughing.</p>

<p>"That is not keeping a watch on you," answered
Pierrot, turning red; "and then, too, it isn't only
me! we were both of us&mdash;M. Giraud&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"What grammar&mdash;good heavens&mdash;what grammar!"
exclaimed M. de Jonzac, in despair.</p>

<p>"What's it matter? If there was anyone here, I'd
take care to put the style on; but when there's
only us!" And then turning to Bijou, he continued:
"It's quite true, you know! M. Giraud was
just as much surprised as I. He kept on saying
all the time: 'We always see mademoiselle every
day hurrying about everywhere, she must be ill!'
And then I'd say, 'Oh, no! it can't be that! the
Bijou is never ill!' You see, Monsieur Giraud, I
was quite right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you were wrong! I was not exactly ill,
but tired, out of sorts. I am only just up."</p>

<p>She walked across to the tutor, who was leaning
so heavily against the window-frame that it seemed
as though he wanted to hollow out a niche for
himself with his back.</p>

<p>"I want to thank you, Monsieur Giraud," said
Bijou, holding out her hand to him, "for being so
kind as to think about me."</p>

<p>Very pale, and visibly embarrassed, the young
man scarcely dared touch the soft little hand lying
so confidingly in his; he looked very delighted,
though, at being treated with such cordiality, as it
was more than he had ever expected again.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he stammered out, seized with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a vague desire either to run away or else to give
way to his emotion, "please do not believe that I
should have taken the liberty of making all those
remarks."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it would not have mattered; there is
plenty of liberty allowed with <i>the Bijou</i>, as Pierrot
would say." And then suddenly looking very
thoughtful and absorbed, she asked: "Have they
been working at the play this morning?"</p>

<p>"Working?" exclaimed Pierrot, with an air of
surprise; "working without you there? Oh, by
jingo, no: it's quite enough to peg away at it when
you are with us, without going at it while you are
away. Oh, no! it would be too bad&mdash;that would!
We had a dose of it last night&mdash;the precious
play&mdash;and I, more particularly, because I am
obliged to work at other things."</p>

<p>Bijou laughed heartily. "Are you not afraid of
tiring yourself with working so hard as all that?"</p>

<p>"If he continues at the rate he is going," said
M. de Jonzac, "he will never take his degree, will
he, Monsieur Giraud?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, monsieur, I am very much
afraid not," replied the tutor gently. "Pierrot is
very intelligent, but so thoughtless, and so absent-minded
always, especially since our arrival here!"</p>

<p>"Oh! not any more than you are, at any rate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Monsieur Giraud," retorted Pierrot. "It's quite
true! I don't know what's the matter with you,
but your thoughts are always wool-gathering, and
you don't go in for books as you did before. Why,
even <i>maths</i> you don't seem so mad on&mdash;you
don't do anything now except look after me, and
go off writing poetry."</p>

<p>"You write poetry, Monsieur Giraud?" asked
Madame de Rueille, entering the room, followed
by Jean and Henry.</p>

<p>"Oh, madame," stuttered the poor fellow, not
knowing where to put himself nor what to say, "I
write some sort, but it is&mdash;not exactly poetry."</p>

<p>"You write charming poetry!" said Jean, and
then, as the young tutor looked at him in astonishment,
he continued: "Yes, you write very good
poetry&mdash;and then you lose it; little Marcel has
just picked up these verses and brought them to
me."</p>

<p>He smiled as he held out to Giraud a folded
paper, the writing on which was invisible.</p>

<p>"Let me see them!" said Bijou, holding out her
hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle!" cried the tutor, stepping
forward, terrified, "please do not insist!" And
then in order to explain his own agitation, he
added: "They are wretched verses; please let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
put them out of sight. I will show you some others
which are more worth looking at."</p>

<p>Bijou's hand was still held out, and she stood
there waiting, looking very frank and innocent.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Jean, let me see these all the same;
that need not prevent M. Giraud writing some
more that we can see, too."</p>

<p>"I cannot show you a letter," replied Jean,
handing the paper to the distracted tutor, "and
this is a kind of letter, and belongs to the person
who wrote it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," stammered out Giraud, thoroughly
abashed, "I am much obliged, monsieur." And
he at once put the troublesome scrap of paper into
his pocket out of sight.</p>

<p>"Pierrot!" called out the marchioness, "give me
'La Bruyère'&mdash;you know where it is?"</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the youth, winking.</p>

<p>"'La Bruyère'?"</p>

<p>"You see," remarked M. de Jonzac, looking at
his son with an expression of despair on his face,
"he does not even know who 'La Bruyère' is!"</p>

<p>Pierrot protested energetically. "Yes, I do
know who he is, and the proof is, I can tell you&mdash;it's
a blue-back."</p>

<p>"A what?" asked the marchioness.</p>

<p>"A blue-back, aunt."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Explain to your aunt," interposed M. Giraud,
"that you have a most objectionable mania for
speaking of books by the colour of the binding
rather than by their title."</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed M. de Jonzac, annoyed,
"he never by any chance opens one. He is an
absolute ignoramus; just to think that he will
soon be seventeen!"</p>

<p>"Poor Pierrot," said Bijou compassionately, "he
is not as ignorant as all that!" And then, as her
uncle did not answer, she added: "And then,
too, he is ever so nice, and he is so strong and
well."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," said M. de Jonzac, "his health
is perfect, and that just makes him all the more
insufferable, but not any more intelligent though.
Everyone complains about the overtaxing of the
intellectual faculties; they say that it is the ruin of
children; and so, by way of improvement, they go
in now for overtaxing them physically, which is a
more certain ruin still."</p>

<p>"Ah, uncle is waging war now," put in Bertrade;
"but I am of his opinion, too, for I do not like
to think that some day my children will add
to the number of the young ruffians we see around
us."</p>

<p>"But," objected Henry de Bracieux, "many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
them&mdash;and some quite young, too&mdash;are very intellectual;
I know some."</p>

<p>"I, too, know some," said Jean de Blaye; "but,
to my way of thinking, they are not precisely intellectual,
they are&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just at this moment a bell was rung in the
hall.</p>

<p>"We must go to luncheon, children," said the
marchioness, rising, "Jean will finish his little definition
for us at table."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not particularly keen about it, aunt,"
said Jean, laughing.</p>

<p>"I am, though; I am no longer 'in the know' of
things, as you say, and I don't object to be
instructed about certain matters on which I am
absolutely ignorant."</p>

<p>On taking her seat at table, the marchioness,
addressing Jean, continued:</p>

<p>"You were saying that the young men who
were not precisely the intellectual ones were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not good at explanations," he
replied.</p>

<p>"That does not matter; go on, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well, those who are not really intellectual are
of the sickly kind; they act that sort of thing to
begin with, and then they end by getting like it
in reality; they are intolerably affected, effeminate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
crazy, and everything else beside. They set up
for being original, and not like anyone else."</p>

<p>"Well, and what do you call them?"</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know; they are of the complex
kind. There's young La Balue, for instance, he's
a perfect example for you of this class; you might
study him."</p>

<p>"That's an idea that has never entered my
head; but, in the young generation of to-day, there
are others beside these complex ones."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are the athletes."</p>

<p>"Specimen, Pierrot!"&mdash;remarked Henry de
Bracieux.</p>

<p>The marchioness turned towards her grandson.</p>

<p>"Don't be personal," she said. "Continue your
little speech, Jean."</p>

<p>"I would rather eat my egg in peace, aunt!"</p>

<p>"We had got as far as the athletes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then, if the complex young men of to-day
are a trifle sickening, the athletes are the
greatest nuisances under the sun. Boxing, football,
bicycles, matches, and records&mdash;all that, they
consider of the most tremendous and vital importance,
not only in their conversation, but,
what is more regrettable still, in their lives. In
their opinion, a man of worth is the one who can
give the hardest blows, or who is endowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the greatest strength or vigour; all their admiration
is bestowed on one single being in the world&mdash;<i>the
Champion</i>, with a capital C."</p>

<p>"And what is there between the complex young
man and the athletes?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; or, at least, some exceptions so rare
that they are there simply to confirm the rule.
Of course, I am only talking now of the young
generation, of the latest&mdash;Pierrot's, in fact."</p>

<p>"Do leave poor Pierrot in peace!" said Bijou;
"you all find fault with him."</p>

<p>"Because it is not too late yet for him to put his
young self to rights, and if he were to be let alone,
he would soon degenerate in the most deplorable
manner."</p>

<p>"Jean is right," agreed M. de Jonzac; "he can
very well afford to give advice to Pierrot, and even
to the others, for he is himself highly intellectual
and very good at sports."</p>

<p>Madame de Bracieux looked at her nephew with
a benevolent expression in her eyes:</p>

<p>"Your uncle is right, my dear boy, you are the
greatest success of the family," she said, and then
seeing that Bijou appeared to be examining her
cousin curiously, she added: "I am only speaking
of the men, of course."</p>

<p>Pierrot leaned over towards Denyse, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
seated next him, and said, in an undertone
with deep gratitude, "It's awfully good of you
to stick up for me always, and I can't tell you
how fond I am of you&mdash;more than any of the
others."</p>

<p>She answered with a smile; and in an almost
maternal way, said:</p>

<p>"That's very wrong! You ought to be much
fonder of uncle, and of grandmamma, too, than you
are of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, to begin with, there's no rule for that,
and then, too, I didn't mean that at all. I meant
that I am fonder of you than all the others are;
and, you know, there's some of them very fond of
you; there's Paul, for instance, Paul de Rueille&mdash;I'm
sure he likes you better than he does
Bertrade, or his children, better than anyone&mdash;even
God!"</p>

<p>"Do be quiet!" said Bijou, alarmed, and looking
round to see if anyone had heard.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a fright! They are all busy worrying
each other; they are not troubling about us.
It's quite true what I said, you know; and then
Jean, too, and Henry, and Monsieur Giraud!
There's scarcely anyone, except Abbé Courteil,
who does not follow you about to every corner you
go; and then&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are talking rubbish! how can you
imagine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't imagine it&mdash;I see it!&mdash;and I see it,
because it annoys me!"</p>

<p>Just at this moment M. de Jonzac's voice was
heard.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he was saying, "I am convinced that
he has no idea that Renan ever existed. He does
not know a thing&mdash;not a single thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," put in the tutor, in his usual gentle
and conciliatory way, "as regards Renan, I
am sure that he knows. Only three or four days
ago I had occasion to quote him as the author of
the 'Origin of Language.'"</p>

<p>"Well, I would wager that he does not even remember
his name&mdash;Pierrot!" called out M. de
Jonzac.</p>

<p>The poor lad, entirely absorbed in his conversation
with Bijou, had no idea that he was
being discussed. On hearing his name called, he
turned his head towards his father, vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p>"Pierrot," asked M. de Jonzac, "who was
Renan?"</p>

<p>"Ah! that's it, is it," said Pierrot to Bijou, "now
they're beginning the examination again. Renan&mdash;who
in the world was he now?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do not know who Renan was, do you?"
asked M. de Jonzac blandly.</p>

<p>"No, father, I don't," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Giraud, surprised; "why,
only the other day we were talking about
him."</p>

<p>"About him?" repeated Pierrot, quite astounded,
"do you mean to say that I was talking about the
man?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;come now; try to remember&mdash;I
mentioned one of his works."</p>

<p>Bijou, who had just before only been listening
with one ear to what Pierrot had been telling her,
so that with the other she could keep up with the
general conversation, remembered the title that had
been quoted. She was looking at her plate, apparently
taken up with the strawberries, which she
was rolling about in the sugar. "The 'Origin of
Language,'" she whispered very quietly.</p>

<p>"Come now, have a good try," repeated the tutor.
"I mentioned one of M. Renan's books to you&mdash;which
one?"</p>

<p>"'The Language of Flowers,'" answered Pierrot
resolutely.</p>

<p>"That's right!" exclaimed Bertrade, delighted:
"we can always reckon on something lively from
Pierrot."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>M. de Jonzac, in spite of his inclination to laugh,
put on a rigid expression. "I do not see anything
amusing in it."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> don't laugh, at any rate," said Pierrot, turning
to Bijou and blushing furiously. "It is awfully
good of you," he added.</p>

<p>After dinner, he drew her out on to the stone
steps, and said, in a beseeching tone:</p>

<p>"Let me come out with you to take the green
stuff to Patatras."</p>

<p>"But I must go and pour out the coffee first."</p>

<p>"Oh, just for once; Bertrade can pour it out right
enough. Come, now, I don't want to go into the
drawing-room; they'd begin asking me something
else."</p>

<p>Denyse started off with him, taking from a shed
the basket in which was prepared for her every day
the bunch of clover she always took to her horse.
She then went on in the direction of the stable,
followed by Pierrot.</p>

<p>"You are awfully nice, Bijou, and so pretty, if
you only knew it," he kept repeating, making his
rough voice almost gentle.</p>

<p>As they crossed the path which led to the stable,
they saw M. de Rueille and Jean de Blaye advancing
towards them, deep in conversation.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Pierrot, "as you weren't in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
drawing-room our two cousins made themselves
scarce there."</p>

<p>Denyse was going forward to meet them, but he
stopped her abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, please don't, they'd stick to us all the time,
and I shouldn't have you to myself at all. It's such
a piece of luck for me to be with you for a minute
without Monsieur Giraud; he's always at my heels,
especially when I'm anywhere near you."</p>

<p>Bijou was looking attentively at the two men,
who were coming towards her, but who were so
deeply absorbed that they had not seen her, and
between her somewhat heavy eyelids appeared that
little gleam which gave at times a singular intensity
of expression to her usually soft-looking eyes.</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered, entering the stable,
"let us take Patatras his clover without them."</p>

<p>M. de Rueille was walking along with his eyes
fixed on the gravel of the garden-path. He looked
up on hearing the door open. Jean de Blaye
pointed to the stable.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "<i>that's</i> the cause of all
the trouble and worry that I can detect in every
single word you say; and it's the cause, too, of the
sort of petty spite that you have against me."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied Rueille, putting on a joking
air; "and what is <i>that</i> pray?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Bijou, of course. Oh, you need not try
to deny it. Do you think I have not followed up,
hour by hour, all that has been passing in your
mind?"</p>

<p>"It must have been interesting."</p>

<p>"Don't humbug; you are scarcely inclined for
that sort of thing just now. I saw very well just
when you began to admire Bijou, quite unconsciously,
more than one does admire, as a rule, a
little cousin one is fond of. It was the evening
of the <i>Grand Prix</i> at Uncle Alexis' when
she sang&mdash;why don't you speak?"</p>

<p>"I am listening to you&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"When we were all here together at Bracieux,
never absent from each other, and you had spent
every minute of the long day in Bijou's society,
your&mdash;let us call it&mdash;your admiration increased, of
course, and ever since yesterday, ever since your
expedition to Pont-sur-Loire, it has been at the
acute stage. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes: you are right."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised; but will you explain
one thing&mdash;one thing which <i>does</i> surprise
me?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why do you appear to have a special grudge
against me? Why against me rather than against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
your brother-in-law, or young La Balue, or Pierrot's
tutor, or even Pierrot himself?"</p>

<p>"Well, Henry is nearly Bijou's own age; he was
brought up with her, and she looks upon him as a
brother exactly. Young La Balue is a regular
caricature; the tutor, a poor wretch who does not
count; and Pierrot, a lad; whilst you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whilst I?"</p>

<p>"Well, as to you, why, you are the sort that
women like, and you know that very well; and I
can see and feel, and, in short, I know, it is you
whom Bijou will care for."</p>

<p>"Me? nonsense! she does not deign to pay the
very slightest attention to me. I am nothing in
her eyes except the man who is breaking in a
horse for her, who takes her out boating, or who
composes couplets for her play."</p>

<p>"In short, you exist more than the others do,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"But why? It's your fancy to look upon young
La Balue as a caricature; but everyone is not of
your opinion. As to Giraud&mdash;well, he is a very
good sort."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he is Giraud."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that? what difference does that
make?"</p>

<p>"A good deal; that is, it would be nothing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
certain women, but it is everything with others,&mdash;and
Bijou is one of these others."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;what do you know about it?"</p>

<p>"I have studied her for some time without
appearing to."</p>

<p>"You are studying her, but you do not know
her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not!"</p>

<p>"If I were in her place I know which one I
should choose amongst so many lovers."</p>

<p>"Ah! they sing that in <i>Les Noces de Jeannette</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh! you won't stop me like that! Amongst
so many lovers, if I had to choose, it would certainly
be Giraud that I should prefer."</p>

<p>"An older woman might admire Giraud, because
he is handsome&mdash;but not a young girl! You see
a young girl's one idea is marriage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, you have no grudge against Giraud,
because, according to you, he is not marriageable,
consequently, not to be feared."</p>

<p>"Precisely!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then, and what about me, my dear
fellow? Do you think I am marriageable, then?
Can you imagine me with my wretched fifteen
hundred a year endeavouring to make Bijou
happy? Yes, can you just imagine it now?&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
house at a hundred a year or so&mdash;petroleum lamps,
coke fires, etc.&mdash;that <i>would</i> be delicious."</p>

<p>"And yet you are in love with her?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I did not say that I was in love
with Bijou. I don't really know; all I can say is,
that she has taken my fancy tremendously, and
that, as I simply cannot marry her, I am wretchedly
unhappy."</p>

<p>"And you don't think she cares for you?"</p>

<p>"Not the least bit in the world! She has never
tried even to deceive me on that point. 'Good-morning!
Good-night! What a fine day it is.'&mdash;that's
the sort of palpitating dialogue which goes
on every day between us. You see, therefore, that
you have no reason to have a spite against me?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Jean, my dear fellow, but I
firmly believed that you were the great favourite."</p>

<p>M. de Rueille broke off suddenly, and appeared
to be straining his ears.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "there she is!"</p>

<p>Bijou was just coming out of the stable, followed,
of course, by Pierrot.</p>

<p>She tripped daintily across towards the two men,
examining them in her calm, smiling way.</p>

<p>"Whatever's the matter with you both?" she
asked; "you look&mdash;I don't know how!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bijou</span> was in the dining-room, arranging the
flowers on the table for dinner, whilst in the
butler's pantry the servants were polishing up
the large silver dishes until they shone brilliantly.</p>

<p>"Get into your coat!" said the butler to the
footman; "there's a carriage coming slowly up the
avenue. Oh, you've got plenty of time, it isn't
here yet."</p>

<p>"Whose carriage is it?" said the footman, looking
through the window.</p>

<p>"I don't know it; it's a fine-looking turn-out,
anyhow. It might very well be the owner of The
Norinière."</p>

<p>"My goodness! it's a clinking turn-out."</p>

<p>"Oh, he can afford it."</p>

<p>"He's got some money, then?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, an awful lot; he's got about sixteen
thousand a year."</p>

<p>"Do you know him, then?"</p>

<p>"My wife was kitchen-maid at his place before I
married her&mdash;a good master he is, always pleasant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and not at all near&mdash;you'd better start now
if you want to get to the steps before he's
there."</p>

<p>A minute before, Bijou, finding that she was
short of flowers, had run out into the garden, and,
springing across the path, had pushed her way into
the middle of a rose-bed, and was now cutting
away mercilessly. She was so absorbed that she
did not hear the carriage, which was coming up the
drive, and which went round the lawn, and pulled
up in front of the stone steps. When at last she
did happen to look up, she saw, a few steps away
from her, a tall gentleman standing gazing at her
with a most rapturous expression.</p>

<p>The fact was that Bijou, in her cotton dress,
with wide pink stripes, and her little apron
trimmed with Valenciennes, was really very pretty
to look at, foraging about amongst the flowers.</p>

<p>When she discovered that she was being gazed
at in this way, her tea-rose complexion took a
deeper tint, and she looked confused and embarrassed,
as she stood there facing the gentleman,
who was still contemplating her without saying a
word.</p>

<p>He was a man of between fifty-five and sixty,
tall, slender, distinguished-looking, and elegant,
and with a very young-looking figure for his years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
His face, which was intelligent and refined, had
also an almost youthful expression about it, just
tinged with a shade of melancholy. As Bijou
remained where she was, and appeared to be hesitating
and not quite at her ease, the visitor approached,
and, raising his hat, said in a very gentle voice:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, mademoiselle, but are you not
Denyse de Courtaix?"</p>

<p>Bijou, with her frank, honest expression, looked
straight into the eyes fixed so curiously upon her,
and answered, smiling:</p>

<p>"Yes, and you?&mdash;you are Monsieur de Clagny,
are you not?"</p>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>Denyse sprang out of the rose-bed on to the
garden-path, and then, without answering the
question in a direct way, she said, with the most
trusting, happy look in her eyes:</p>

<p>"Oh! how glad grandmamma will be to see
you, and Uncle Alexis, too; ever since they
heard that you were coming back to live here, they
have talked of nothing else. Let's go at once to
find grandmamma."</p>

<p>She started off, leading the way, looking most
graceful and supple, as she passed through the
large rooms with that gliding movement which was
one of her greatest charms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The marchioness was not in the room where she
was usually to be found. Bijou rang the bell, and
requested the servant to find Madame de Bracieux.
She then took a seat opposite M. de Clagny, and
examined him attentively.</p>

<p>"Paul de Rueille was quite right after all," she
said, "when he told me that I had seen you long
ago&mdash;I recognise you." She gazed with her bright
eyes more fixedly into the count's, and repeated
pensively: "I certainly do recognise you."</p>

<p>"Well, I confess, in all sincerity," said M. de
Clagny, "that if I had met you anywhere else than
at Bracieux, I should not have recognised <i>you</i>&mdash;you
are so much bigger, you know, and then, so
much more beautiful that, with the exception of
the lovely violet eyes, which have not changed,
there is nothing remaining of the little baby-girl of
years ago."</p>

<p>"The name which you gave me still remains."</p>

<p>"The name? what name?" he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Bijou! don't you remember? it seems that it
was you who used to call me that."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true! you seemed to me such a
fragile little thing, so adorable and so rare&mdash;a bijou
in fact, an exquisite little bijou. And so they have
continued to call you by that name&mdash;it suits you,
too, wonderfully well."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think so! I am afraid it is rather
ridiculous to be still <i>Bijou</i> at the age of twenty-one,
for, you know, I am twenty-one now."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Very possible! in four years from now I shall
be quite an old maid!"</p>

<p>The count looked at Bijou with an admiration
which he did not attempt to dissimulate, as he
answered emphatically:</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> an old maid? oh, never in the world,
never!"</p>

<p>Madame de Bracieux was just entering the
room.</p>

<p>"How glad I am to see you!" she said, looking
delighted, and holding out her hands to her visitor.</p>

<p>As Denyse was moving towards the door, the
marchioness called her back.</p>

<p>"I see Bijou has introduced herself," she said to
Clagny, who had not yet got over his admiration,
"What do you think of my grand-daughter?" And
then, without giving him time to answer, she
went on quickly: "It's just the same <i>Bijou</i> you
used to admire years ago, just the same! the
genuine <i>Bijou</i>, there's no <i>sham</i> about it, as my
grandsons would say."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Denyse is charming."</p>

<p>"Denyse (and, by the way, you will oblige me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
by not calling her mademoiselle) is a dear,
good girl, obedient and devoted. Her gaiety has
brightened up my old house, which was gloomy
enough before her arrival."</p>

<p>"How is it that I have never seen Mademoiselle
Denyse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle again!"</p>

<p>"That I have never seen Bijou in Paris? I
come so regularly on your day."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you always come very early, at an
hour when she is never there, and then for the
last sixteen years you have never dined with
us."</p>

<p>"I never dine out anywhere, you know; but
you have never spoken of Bijou, never told me
anything about her."</p>

<p>"Because you have never asked me about her."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten about her, to tell the truth, the
tiny, baby-child that I saw so little of, and yet
just now, when I saw a delicious girl emerging
from a rose-bed, I hadn't the slightest hesitation,
had I, mademoiselle?" and then correcting himself,
he added, laughing: "had I, Bijou?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true! M. de Clagny asked me at
once if I were not Denyse de Courtaix&mdash;&mdash;and I,
too, knew at once who he was; I had heard
so much about him that I seemed to know him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
my imagination, and, it's very odd&mdash;" She broke
off suddenly, and then after gazing thoughtfully at
the count, she added: "I knew him in my imagination
just as he is in reality."</p>

<p>"A very old man," said Clagny, with a kind
of sad playfulness.</p>

<p>"No!" replied Bijou, evidently sincere, "a
very handsome man!" And then abruptly
breaking off, she said: "And Uncle Alexis has
not appeared yet; they have rung the bell with all
their might in vain, for he doesn't come; I'll go
and find him!"</p>

<p>She was hurrying away when the marchioness
called her back:</p>

<p>"Stop a minute!&mdash;have another place laid at
table. You will dine with us, Clagny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you have no one here."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I have; I am just expecting some
friends of yours."</p>

<p>"And I am a regular bear, for I do not even
dine with my friends; and then, too, in this
get-up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your get-up is all right, and, besides, there is
time to send to The Norinière for your coat if you
particularly care to have it."</p>

<p>"I do care to, if I stay."</p>

<p>Bijou approached, and said, in a coaxing way:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will stay&mdash;and do you know what would
be very, very nice of you? well, it would be to stay
just as you are, without your dress-coat."</p>

<p>"Why do you insist, Bijou, if it annoys him to
stay without dressing?" asked the marchioness.</p>

<p>"Because, grandmamma, if M. de Clagny were
to dine without his dress-coat, M. Giraud could,
too; and otherwise he will have to dine all by
himself in his room."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, child?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's very simple. M. Giraud has no
dress-coat; he hasn't one at all. I got to know it
by chance; he told Baptiste just now that he was
not very well, and that he should not leave his
room this evening, and so, if M. de Clagny would
stay just as he is, don't you see, he could, too&mdash;M.
Giraud, I mean."</p>

<p>"What a good little Bijou you are!" said the
marchioness, quite touched; "you think of everyone;
you do nothing but find ways of giving
pleasure to all."</p>

<p>Denyse was not listening to this. She was
waiting for the count to give his consent.</p>

<p>"Would it be a great, great pleasure to you,"
he asked at length, "if this Monsieur Giraud could
dine at table?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it shall be as you wish. Tell me, though,
now, who is this gentleman with whom I am not
acquainted, and for whose sake I am consenting to
appear as a most ill-bred man?"</p>

<p>"He is Pierrot's coach."</p>

<p>"Ah! and what's this Pierrot?"</p>

<p>"The son of Alexis," said Madame de Bracieux
laughing.</p>

<p>"Then the god to whom I am to be sacrificed
is M. Giraud, tutor to Pierrot de Jonzac, and he is
honoured by the patronage of Mademoiselle
Denyse. Thank you, I like to know how things
are."</p>

<p>"But," protested Denyse, turning very red, "I
do not patronise M. Giraud at all. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do not attempt to defend yourself. I
know what kind of a role a poor tutor without a
dress-coat must play in the life of a beautiful young
lady like you; it is just a role of no account; he
represents as exactly as possible <i>a gentleman of no
importance</i> in a play."</p>

<p>"You have no idea," said the marchioness, when
Denyse had gone away, "how good that child
is. This young man in whom she is interested,
and who, by the bye, is really charming, is always
treated by her exactly on the same footing as
the most influential and the most distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
men she meets. Oh, she is a pearl, is Bijou; you
will see!"</p>

<p>"I shall see it perhaps too clearly."</p>

<p>"How do you mean&mdash;too clearly?"</p>

<p>"I am very susceptible, you know. I have a
foolish old heart, which sounds an alarm at the
slightest danger, and which afterwards I cannot
silence again."</p>

<p>"But Bijou is my grand-daughter, my poor old
friend."</p>

<p>"Well, what difference does that make?"</p>

<p>"Why, just this&mdash;that she might be yours."</p>

<p>"I know all that well enough. Good heavens!&mdash;that
is what you might call reasoning; and
hearts that remain young either reason very little
or very badly."</p>

<p>"And so?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said M. de Clagny, making an effort to
laugh, "I was joking, of course."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Bijou had crossed the court-yard. The heat
was very great, and the peacocks, perched on the
trunk of a tree that had been felled, looked stupid
and ridiculous, whilst the dogs, lying on their sides,
with their legs stretched out, were panting under
the sun's rays, but were too lazy to look for any
shade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>No one was out of doors at that torrid hour, except
Pierrot, who, arrayed in a white linen suit,
with a wide straw hat on his head, was strolling
about under the chestnut trees, which formed a
V shaped avenue.</p>

<p>Denyse ran up the steps, and entered the schoolroom
like a gust of wind. On the threshold,
however, she stopped short, and seemed confused.
M. Giraud, who had been seated at the table, had
risen hastily on seeing her appear.</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg your pardon," she stammered out,
"I wanted to speak to Pierrot. I thought he was
here, and that you had gone for your walk."</p>

<p>Very much embarrassed, the young tutor could
scarcely find any words with which to reply.</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle, no! I am here you see. It
is just the contrary, for Pierrot has gone out, but,
if you like, if I could tell him what&mdash;for&mdash;you have
something to say to him probably?"</p>

<p>He lost his head completely as he looked at her
standing there. She was so pretty with her complexion,
still pink and white, in spite of the terrible
heat, and her large eyes, with their changing expression,
were fixed on him with such a gentle
look.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," she said, slightly embarrassed
too, "I wanted to speak to Pierrot; although it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
about something that concerns you&mdash;it would be
better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Something which concerns me?" interrupted
Giraud, looking uneasy; "but I do not know really&mdash;I
wonder what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The thought flashed across him that she was
perhaps going to say that, after what had taken
place the night before last, he could not remain any
longer at Bracieux. He was in despair, for not
only would he have to leave Bijou, but he would
probably get no employment for the next two
months, just as he had thought to have a little
peace and comfort.</p>

<p>The young girl was looking at him, and smiling
kindly.</p>

<p>"You see, it is very difficult to say it to&mdash;to the
person concerned," she answered at length.</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;Pierrot."</p>

<p>"Oh! Pierrot is not a very clever diplomatist, I
grant, but he would have known better than I do
how to go about things in order to announce to
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To announce to me?"</p>

<p>"The fact that you are going to dine with us this
evening. A headache, you know, is a very good
excuse for women, but only for women."</p>

<p>"But, mademoiselle, without taking into account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the annoyance it would be to me (and it would
annoy me very much) not to be dressed as the
others are, it would not be polite towards your
guests."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are perhaps right; it would not be the
thing, perhaps, if you were the only one who was
not in evening dress; but there will be M. de Clagny
just as he is now, to pay a call; so you understand."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I caught sight of M. de Clagny
just now when he arrived. He is an old gentleman,
and as such can take liberties about certain matters
which I, particularly in my position, could not."</p>

<p>"As to you, you are just going to obey grandmamma
like a good little boy, for it was grandmamma
who sent me, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah!" murmured the young man, disappointed,
"it was your grandmamma? I was hoping it
was you, who&mdash;but you are still vexed with me, of
course?"</p>

<p>"Vexed with you?" she asked, surprised; "what
for?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;because&mdash;oh, you know&mdash;the other evening&mdash;when,
in spite of myself, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bijou's merry face clouded over as she said very
seriously:</p>

<p>"I thought that would never be brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
again. I wish you to forget what you said to
me." She stood still a moment, with a pensive
look on her beautiful face, and then she added, in
a muffled voice: "And, above all, I wish to forget
it myself."</p>

<p>Her eyelids were lowered, and her eyelashes
were beating quickly against her pink cheeks
throwing a strange shadow over her brilliant
complexion.</p>

<p>Giraud went up to her, anxious and excited, and
in a stammering voice he asked:</p>

<p>"Is it true what you have just said? Do you
still remember that moment of madness? Can
you think of it without anger?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, gazing full at him with her
beautiful blue eyes, "I think of it without anger,"
and then, in such a low voice that he could scarcely
hear it, she murmured, "and I <i>do</i> think of it all
the time!" Then, with a sudden change of
expression, she began again hurriedly: "It is you
who must forget now; you must forget at once&mdash;what
I ought never to have said to you! Please
forget it! Do as I ask you, for my sake!"</p>

<p>"Forget? How do you think that I can forget?
You know well enough that it is absolutely
impossible!"</p>

<p>"You must, though!" she persisted. "Yes, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
must say to yourself that you&mdash;that we have had a
dream&mdash;a very bright, happy dream,&mdash;one of those
sort from which one wakes up happy, and, at the
same time, troubled; a dream in which one has a
vision of beautiful things, which disappear, and
which we cannot possibly define. Have you never
had such dreams? One cannot, no matter how
much one tries, remember all about them; and
yet&mdash;one likes them."</p>

<p>Her voice, with its caressing intonation, completely
unnerved the young man. He had taken his
seat again mechanically at the table, and, without
replying, he looked up at Bijou, his eyes full of
tears.</p>

<p>She came nearer, and said in a beseeching tone:</p>

<p>"Ah! please don't, if you only knew how
wretched it makes me&mdash;" and then she added
abruptly: "and if it is any consolation to you&mdash;you
can say to yourself that you are not the only
one to suffer&mdash;for I do, too."</p>

<p>"Is it really, really true?" he asked, bewildered
with his happiness.</p>

<p>Denyse did not answer. She had just noticed
on the table a letter, which Giraud had been finishing
when she entered the room.</p>

<p>"I was writing to my brother," he said, following
the direction of her eyes, "and instead of telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
him about my pupil, and my occupations, and, in
short, about such things as, in my position of life, I
ought to confine myself to, I have only told him
about you."</p>

<p>"I was looking at your name," she answered,
pointing with her rosy finger to the signature;
"Fred&mdash;it is a name I am fond of; I gave it to my
little godchild, the youngest of Bertrade's children."
She seemed to be looking far away through the
open window as she repeated very gently: "Fred!"
And then passing her little hand over her forehead,
and walking towards the door, she said
abruptly: "And this dinner&mdash;and my flowers for
the table,&mdash;why, the <i>menus</i> are not written yet, and
it is five o'clock!" And then, as the poor fellow
looked stupefied and did not attempt to move, she
went on: "It's settled about this evening, is it not?
I shall have your place laid?"</p>

<p>He answered, in a vague, bewildered way, coming
gradually to himself again:</p>

<p>"Amongst all the others in dress-coats, I shall
cut the most ridiculous figure."</p>

<p>"Oh, no,&mdash;nothing of the kind! Besides, they
will not all be in dress-coats. First of all, there is
M. de Clagny in a frock-coat; and then M. de
Bernès, who is afraid of meeting his General,
and so is always arrayed in his uniform:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
then the abbé in his cassock," and with a laugh she
concluded: "That makes three of them who will
not be in dress-coats!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>As she was leaving the schoolroom, she ran
against Henry de Bracieux, who was coming
towards her in the corridor.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" he exclaimed, in surprise.
"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I? Why, I was going back to my room."</p>

<p>"And I was coming away from Pierrot's."</p>

<p>"Pierrot is in the garden."</p>

<p>"I did not know, and I had something to say to
him."</p>

<p>"To him?" asked the young man suspiciously,
and almost aggressively, "or to M. Giraud?"</p>

<p>Without appearing to notice her cousin's singular
attitude towards her, she answered, in a docile way:</p>

<p>"To him, so that he might repeat it to M.
Giraud, but as he was not there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is to Giraud that you have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Given grandmamma's message. Yes," and
then, with an innocent expression in her eyes,
she asked: "Why does it interest you so much to
know whether I gave this message to the one rather
than to the other?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>He replied, in a joking tone, but with some
embarrassment:</p>

<p>"Because I am inquisitive, probably; and the
proof that I am inquisitive is that I should like to
know what this message was."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma commissioned me to tell M.
Giraud, who has no dress-coat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No dress-coat&mdash;Giraud?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Not a dress-coat at all?"</p>

<p>"There, you say just what I did. No, not a
dress-coat of any description! He had sent word
that he would not dine with us; and then, as M.
de Clagny is staying to dinner, and he is in a frock-coat,
I was going to tell Pierrot, so that he could let
M. Giraud know. Do you understand now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Henry, "quite well&mdash;but Jean
is very <i>chic</i> and never goes about without
a change of dress-coats; he has, at least, three
here; he would certainly lend him one&mdash;they are
exactly the same figure."</p>

<p>"That would be nice!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he would be glad to do it! Giraud is a
very nice fellow; we should all like him, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short, and Bijou asked:</p>

<p>"If what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing! I'll go and see about this business&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
old Clagny's time of life it doesn't matter
whether one is got up all right or not; but for
Giraud, it's another thing. I am sure he would
feel it very much if he thought he looked ridiculous,
especially&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Especially?"</p>

<p>"Especially before you!"</p>

<p>Bijou shrugged her shoulders, and ran away
down the long corridor.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Bijou had superintended the laying of
the cloth, and had herself attended to the flowers,
the service, and the <i>menus</i>, she was ready for dinner
before anyone else.</p>

<p>Carrying in her arms an enormous bunch
of roses, she entered the drawing-room just
as the marchioness had gone upstairs to
dress.</p>

<p>She was so much taken up with arranging her
flowers on a side-table that she did not see M.
de Clagny, who was watching her attentively as
she came and went, with the pretty, graceful movements
of a bird as it flies backwards and forwards
before finally perching itself.</p>

<p>At length, however, he spoke, and the sound of
his voice made Denyse start.</p>

<p>"It's very certain that it came direct from Paris&mdash;that
pretty dress," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Bijou, scared, "you nearly
frightened me." And then, going up to the
count, and daintily patting her light, gauzy dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
she continued: "That pretty dress did not
come from Paris; it was made at Bracieux, near
Pont-sur-Loire."</p>

<p>Thoroughly astonished, the count asked:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! by whom, then?"</p>

<p>"By Denyse, here present, and by an old sewing-woman,
who is a dresser at the theatre."</p>

<p>He had risen, and was now walking round the
young girl in almost timid admiration. She was
so pretty, emerging from the pinky-looking cloud,
which seemed to scarcely touch her dainty little
figure, and out of which peeped her shoulders,
tinted, too, with that singular pinky gleam which
made her delicate skin look so velvety and
soft.</p>

<p>M. de Clagny could not help thinking that Bijou
was not only beautiful to look at, but fascinating
in the extreme, with her tempting mouth, and her
innocent, frank eyes. The charm of her person
was rendered all the more complex by this same
child-like expression.</p>

<p>Whilst he was examining her curiously, Bijou
was saying to herself that "this old friend of
grandmamma's" was much younger-looking than
she had imagined him to be. He certainly did
make a good appearance, tall and slender, with his
hair quite white on his temples, whilst his fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
moustache had scarcely a touch of grey. His
brown eyes had a gentle expression, and his mouth,
sometimes mocking, and at times even almost cruel,
showed, when he smiled, the sharp, white teeth,
which lighted up his whole face in a singular
way.</p>

<p>The silence was getting embarrassing, until
Bijou at last broke it:</p>

<p>"Grandmamma has not come down then yet? I
expected to find her here."</p>

<p>"She went away to dress just as you came in."</p>

<p>"She will never be ready."</p>

<p>M. de Clagny looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"But dinner is to be at eight&mdash;she has plenty of
time; it is not half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Bijou regretfully. "If only I
had known, I should not have hurried so much. I
was so afraid of being late."</p>

<p>"I'm the one to be glad that you hurried so
much. I shall have you to talk to for a minute"&mdash;</p>

<p>"For a good half-hour at least," she said,
laughing; "no one is ever in advance here&mdash;oh,
never, not even the guests any more than the
people of the house."</p>

<p>"Ah, about the guests, tell me with whom I am
going to dine. Your grandmamma said, 'You will
dine with some friends of yours.' Now, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
friends, I cannot have many here now, considering
that for the last twelve years I have not been
in this part of the world. There have probably
been many changes since then."</p>

<p>"Not so many as all that; let's see, now! you
will dine with the Tourvilles."</p>

<p>"The Tourvilles? they are not dead yet?"</p>

<p>"Those with whom you are going to dine are
living. They had some parents who are dead."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's it, is it! then young Tourville is
married?"</p>

<p>"Yes, two years ago!"</p>

<p>"He was a disagreeable fellow! Has he made a
good marriage?"</p>

<p>"That depends! he married a young lady on the
Stock Exchange."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? a young lady on the
Stock Exchange?"</p>

<p>"Yes, her father is something there, I believe;
he is very, very rich."</p>

<p>"Is it Chaillot, the banker?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, I never asked about them&mdash;they
have restored Tourville, it is superb now; and they
are always entertaining."</p>

<p>"Is Madame de Tourville pretty?"</p>

<p>"You will see her; she is very pleasant, and
they say she is very intelligent; for my part, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
not discovered that." And then, as M. de Clagny
smiled, she added quickly: "Because I only know
her very slightly."</p>

<p>"Well, and after the Tourvilles, who next?"</p>

<p>"M. de Bernès."</p>

<p>"Young Hubert, the dragoon?"</p>

<p>"He himself."</p>

<p>"He is the son of good friends of mine; a
downright nice fellow, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Don't I think what?"</p>

<p>"That Hubert de Bernès is nice?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I know him so slightly; he has always
seemed to me&mdash;how shall I express it?&mdash;insipid,
yes, insipid."</p>

<p>"Because you intimidate him, probably? I can
quite understand that, too!"</p>

<p>"I intimidate <i>you</i>, perhaps?" she said, laughing.</p>

<p>"Very much so!" he answered, very seriously.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, in astonishment, "how is
that possible?"</p>

<p>"It is very possible, and it is true! There's
nothing astonishing about it then, that if you
intimidate an old man like me, you should intimidate
poor little Hubert."</p>

<p>"Little Hubert? he is six feet!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he is twenty-six years old, but to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
he is always little Hubert. Well, anyhow, admit
at least that he is handsome?"</p>

<p>"I don't know!"</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me that you have not
looked at him?"</p>

<p>"I have looked at him; but as regards M. de
Bernès I am a very bad judge."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Because I detest young men!"</p>

<p>"At the age of twenty-six they are not so young
as all that!"</p>

<p>"That may be so! but, all the same, at that age
they do not exist as far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"Well, well! and at what age do they begin to
exist as far as you are concerned?"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Very late in life!" she said, and then suddenly
changing her tone, she continued: "I am glad you
know M. de Bernès, because, at any rate, you will
not be bored to death now this evening."</p>

<p>"Ah! it appears, then, that I am not to count on
the other guests for entertainment?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! the others&mdash;well, first of all there are
the La Balues."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, they are alarming! Why,
their children must be beginning to grow
up?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"They have even finished growing up! Louis
is twenty-three, and Gisèle twenty-two."</p>

<p>"What are they like?"</p>

<p>"The one sets up for being <i>blasé</i>&mdash;-he
is never either hungry, thirsty, or sleepy; he
does not care for anything; everything bores him.
And it is not true, you know! he never misses a
dance, and his sister says that he gets up in the
night to eat on the sly. Then, too, he writes
ridiculous poetry, paints pictures as absurd as
his poetry, and goes in for music&mdash;such music!"</p>

<p>"And the daughter?"</p>

<p>"She is as masculine as her brother is effeminate;
she goes shooting and hunting, and her dream is
to go in for deer-stalking, and to marry an
officer."</p>

<p>"She is probably thinking of Hubert?"</p>

<p>"What Hubert?"</p>

<p>"Young Bernès!"</p>

<p>"Ah! But I don't fancy so! At all events,
he is not thinking about her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because he is too much taken up with you, like
all the others; is not that so?"</p>

<p>"Not at all!"</p>

<p>M. de Clagny shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" he said, "I can see it all quite
plainly."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are only three guests left now for me to
introduce to you," continued Bijou, evidently wishing
to change the subject of the conversation.
"There are the Juzencourts&mdash;people who are very
much up-to-date, and who have bought 'The
Pines'&mdash;and one of their friends who is staying
for a month with them, a delightful young widow,
the Viscountess de Nézel."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the count, with an abrupt
movement; "Madame de Nézel&mdash;Jean de Blaye is
here then?"</p>

<p>Denyse opened her beautiful, bright eyes wide,
as she replied in astonishment:</p>

<p>"Yes, Jean is here; but what has that to do
with&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing at all! nothing at all!" said M. de
Clagny hastily, and then after a moment's silence,
he asked: "Is Madame de Nézel as pretty as
ever?"</p>

<p>"She is very pretty."</p>

<p>"As pretty as you?"</p>

<p>Bijou smiled. "Why do you make fun of me?
I know very well that I am not pretty," she said.</p>

<p>"It's my turn now, my dear little Bijou, to ask
why you make fun of an old friend who admires
you as much as it is possible to admire anyone, and
who, alas! is not the only one."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you say alas?"</p>

<p>"Well, because when one admires or loves, one
would like to be the only one to admire or love;
one's affection makes one selfish and jealous."</p>

<p>"And after&mdash;let me see&mdash;how long&mdash;three hours&mdash;yes,
after three hours' acquaintance, you already
have some affection for me?" asked Bijou, looking
quite joyful.</p>

<p>"Yes, a great deal!" answered M. de Clagny
very seriously.</p>

<p>"So much the better, because, you see, I too, I
like you very much!" And, as though she
were just talking to herself, she added: "I
had imagined you very different, I expected to
see you not at all like you are."</p>

<p>"Younger?" he asked sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, just the opposite; they had always
spoken of you as a friend of grandpapa's, and
grandmamma always said, 'my old friend Clagny,'
so that you can understand when I saw you, I was
quite surprised."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because you looked to me to be&mdash;I don't know
exactly&mdash;about forty-five perhaps?&mdash;well, say
like Paul de Rueille; and then, you are very
handsome, and, for my part, I like people who
are handsome."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your cousin De Blaye is handsome!"</p>

<p>"Jean?" she said, as though she were turning it
over in her mind, "is he as handsome as all that?
He does not strike me in that way, you see. When
people are always together they end by not noticing
each other!"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure that he notices you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! people don't notice me as much as you
think! They care for me because I was left alone
in the world at the age of seventeen; and then,
when grandmamma took possession of me, like
some poor little stray dog, and carried me off to
her home, why, they all felt interested in me, and
made me very welcome, and I was their Bijou
whom they all tried to bring up and to spoil, whose
faults are always looked over, and who always has
her own way."</p>

<p>"And Bijou is quite right; that's the only good
thing there is in life&mdash;having one's own way, when
one can."</p>

<p>"One always can," she said, speaking as though
she were not aware that she was saying anything,
and then suddenly advancing towards the bay-window,
she exclaimed: "Ah! there, now! the
Tourvilles! and grandmamma is not down stairs
again yet!"</p>

<p>Bijou went forward to greet the new-comers&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
lady dressed very handsomely, followed by a
common-looking sort of man, with very stiff
manners, who, on the whole, was decidedly
snobbish.</p>

<p>Bijou introduced them, "Count de Clagny,
Count de Tourville," and then, as the marchioness
entered the room, looking very handsome
still in her cloudy lace draperies, the young girl
turned to M. de Clagny again.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "and what do you think of
the Tourvilles?"</p>

<p>"I don't admire them. But how much Henry
de Bracieux has improved in appearance; he is
not as good-looking as his cousin yet; but that
may come, perhaps."</p>

<p>"As good-looking as which cousin?"</p>

<p>"As Blaye."</p>

<p>"Again. Oh, well! you will insist on this
beauty of Jean's."</p>

<p>"Well, beauty is perhaps not just the word; but
he is charming; if you will allow me to say
that?"</p>

<p>"I will allow it."</p>

<p>"By the bye, do tell me who that very nice-looking
young man is whom I met just now at the
end of the avenue?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, unless it were Pierrot's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
tutor; but he is not so very nice-looking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look, there he is," said M. de Clagny, indicating
M. Giraud.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Bijou, in astonishment; "yes,
that is he!"</p>

<p>She was amazed both at the count's admiration,
and at the transformation which Jean's dress-coat
had made.</p>

<p>Arrayed in this garment of a perfect cut, and
which fitted him wonderfully well, the young tutor
looked quite at his ease.</p>

<p>"Well," said Henry, coming up to Denyse,
"wasn't my idea a bright one? Do you see
the difference?"&mdash;and then, as she did not
answer quickly enough for his liking, he added:
"I'll bet anything you don't see it; women
never can see those things when it's a question
of men."</p>

<p>The guests were all arriving. First the La
Balues, imperturbable, absurd in the extreme,
but so blissfully happy, so full of admiration,
and so perfectly satisfied with themselves that
one would have been sorry to have undeceived
them. Then came Hubert de Bernès, arrayed,
as Bijou had prophesied, in his uniform, and
looking all round the drawing-room carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
afraid of meeting what he was in the habit
of calling '<i>any big pots</i>.' The Juzencourts arrived
last of all, bringing with them Madame de
Nézel, a very pretty and exquisitely-dressed
woman. She was extremely refined-looking and
supple, with that suppleness peculiar to Creoles;
she had a jessamine-like complexion, and heavy,
silky hair of jet black.</p>

<p>Bijou, who was looking at her with an expression
of curiosity, as though she had never seen her
before, remarked to M. de Clagny:</p>

<p>"Madame de Nézel is really very pretty&mdash;isn't
she?"</p>

<p>He replied, in an absent sort of way, devouring
Bijou all the time with his eyes:</p>

<p>"There is no mistaking that she comes of good
family, and then, too, she's very womanly, and
would respond&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young girl knitted her eyebrows as though
she were making an effort to understand.</p>

<p>"And would what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," answered the count, annoyed
with himself. "I don't know what I was going to
say."</p>

<p>"Bijou!" called out the marchioness suddenly,
"Madame de Juzencourt wants to see the children;
go and fetch them. You will allow them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
come down, Bertrade? and you, too, monsieur?"
she added, turning to the abbé.</p>

<p>M. de Clagny looked vexed at being separated
from Denyse. It seemed to him already as though
he could not do without her.</p>

<p>She soon came back, followed by Marcel and
Robert, leading by the hand a superb baby-child
of four years old, who was smiling amiably
and confidingly as he trotted along.</p>

<p>"This is my godson," she said, introducing him
with evident pride. "Isn't he a pet, and so
beautiful and good. He's a love!"</p>

<p>"Bijou is so good to that child," said Madame de
Rueille, "she is always looking after him and is
teaching him now to read."</p>

<p>"So early!" exclaimed M. de Clagny, in a reproachful
tone, "is he being taught to read
already?"</p>

<p>"Bijou teaches him plenty of other things, too,
don't you, Bijou?" asked the marchioness; "you
are teaching him Bible history, are you not? Two
days ago he told me about Moses, and he knew
it all very well."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the count jeeringly, "I
should like to hear that. Poor unfortunate little
mite!"</p>

<p>In a graceful, winsome way, Bijou knelt down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
by the child. On hearing "his story" mentioned,
the poor little fellow looked at her beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Now, Fred, tell it," she said.</p>

<p>Docile, but with a discontented expression on his
face, the little fellow looked up at his god-mother.</p>

<p>"Tell about Moses, you know it very well."</p>

<p>"Well then," began Fred resolutely, "they put
him in a 'ittle basket, 'ittle Moses, and they put the
basket on the Nile&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, his face bathed in perspiration.</p>

<p>"And then, what happened?" asked Bijou.</p>

<p>"Don't know," replied the little fellow briefly;
"don't know any more&mdash;don't know, I tell you.
Say it yourself&mdash;what happened."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! come now, have you made up your
mind not to answer?"</p>

<p>The child replied coaxingly:</p>

<p>"P'ease don't make me say it!"</p>

<p>Denyse insisted, however.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! now something happened when Moses
was going down the Nile. What was it&mdash;what
happened?"</p>

<p>He thought for a minute, his face puckered up,
his eyes shut, and then, just when everyone had
given up hoping for anything more, he cried out,
delighted at having remembered:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Puss in boots came! and called out: 'Help!
help! it's the Marquis of Carabas&mdash;he's drowning.'"</p>

<p>"There, you see," said Bertrade, laughing, "this
is what comes of teaching him so many fine things
at the same time."</p>

<p>M. de Rueille added:</p>

<p>"Yes, a day or two ago Denyse gave him a
stunning 'Puss in Boots' that we brought with us
from Pont-sur-Loire, and this has evidently done
Moses a great deal of harm."</p>

<p>Bijou turned towards her cousin, and exclaimed
in astonishment:</p>

<p>"Denyse! how long have you taken to calling
me Denyse?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," answered Rueille, "sometimes
I do."</p>

<p>"Why, you never do! I thought you were
vexed," and then, bending towards her godchild, and
taking him up in her arms, she said, laughing:
"My poor little Fred, we have not had much
success this time, have we?"</p>

<p>Giraud, who was standing just behind her, gazed
at her admiringly. She clasped the child, who was
smiling at her, closer still, and murmured in a
caressing tone:</p>

<p>"Fred! my dear Fred! I do so love you, if you
only knew."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>On hearing his own name pronounced so tenderly,
the young tutor had started involuntarily, and he
had had the greatest difficulty in keeping himself
from advancing towards Denyse. He had turned
so pale, too, and such a strange, drawn look had
come over his face, that Pierrot, who, as a rule, was
not endowed with much power of observation except
in matters relating to Bijou, noticed it, and
asked:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Monsieur Giraud?
you look so queer! are you ill?"</p>

<p>Denyse turned round abruptly, and asked with
interest:</p>

<p>"You are not well, Monsieur Giraud?"</p>

<p>"I? oh, yes! perfectly well, thank you, mademoiselle.
I don't know what made Pierrot fancy that."</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" said the youth, with conviction,
"look at yourself; you look awfully queer!
Besides, for the last three or four days you have
not been yourself; you must have something the
matter that you don't know of."</p>

<p>"I assure you," stuttered the poor fellow, in a
perfect torture, "I assure you that there is nothing
the matter with me."</p>

<p>M. de Clagny had approached them. He was
looking enviously at little Fred nestling against
Bijou's pretty shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your godson is perfectly superb!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't he? and he adores me!"</p>

<p>Dinner was announced just at this moment, and
Bijou gave the child, who was getting sleepy, to
the English nurse who had come for him.</p>

<p>With a disagreeable expression on his face,
young La Balue, who was standing just by Denyse,
offered her the sharp angle of his arm. With some
difficulty she managed to slip her hand through,
and, with a resigned look on her face, went in with
him to dinner.</p>

<p>At table M. Giraud was at the other side of her,
and half wild with delight at finding himself placed
next her, he felt that he was more shy and awkward
than ever. His timidity, which had hitherto
been extreme, seemed to increase. He dared not
say a word, and he was in despair, because
he felt that he was making himself ridiculous.</p>

<p>He was not only in love with Denyse for
her beauty, her grace, and her wonderful charm,
but he venerated her for her goodness, which
seemed to him to be infinite.</p>

<p>When he had been an usher in a certain college,
he had one day murmured some foolish words of
affection to the daughter of the headmaster, and he
remembered still with awe the contemptuous anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with which the young lady had reproached him for
having, in his position, dared to lift his eyes to
her.</p>

<p>He had now frankly and bluntly told this
beautiful, wealthy, and nobly-born girl that he
adored her, and, in reply, she had spoken to him
sweetly and affectionately, discouraging him, but
taking care not to wound him.</p>

<p>He began now to pity himself and his own fate,
firmly believing that his life, having been crossed
by this hopeless love, would be wretched for ever-more.</p>

<p>How could he expect that, having once known
and loved a woman like Mademoiselle de Courtaix,
he would ever be able to love any woman whom he
would be in a position to marry.</p>

<p>And the poor young man, who, only three short
weeks before, used to dream at times of a little
home presided over by a young wife, who should
be sweet and modest, though, perhaps, not remarkable
in any way, saw himself now condemned for
life to a bachelor's dreary rooms, where, in the end,
he would die, surrounded by photographs of Bijou,
which he would get with great difficulty from
Pierrot.</p>

<p>At the beginning of dinner Denyse did not talk
much. She looked round in an absent sort of way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
at the whole table, noticing all those little nothings
which are so amusing to persons capable of seeing
them.</p>

<p>Madame de Bracieux had M. de la Balue to her
right, but she was neglecting him for the sake of
her old friend, Clagny, who was on her other side,
and to whom she never ceased talking.</p>

<p>M. de Jonzac, who was opposite his sister, between
Madame de la Balue and Madame de Tourville,
only appeared to be enjoying himself in a
moderate degree. Madame de Nézel also looked
rather sad, and talked in a half-hearted way to her
neighbours, Henry de Bracieux and M. de Rueille.
She glanced often in the direction of Jean de Blaye,
who was seated at the other end of the table, between
Madame de Juzencourt and Mademoiselle
de la Balue. Jean did not seem to be taking any
notice of Madame de Nézel, and several times
Bijou saw that his eyes were fixed on her. She
found this embarrassing; so turning towards
young Balue, started an animated conversation
with him, and thereupon Jean, with a somewhat
troubled expression in his eyes, watched her all
the time.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> dinner the heat in the drawing-room was
over-powering, and Madame de Bracieux said to
her guests:</p>

<p>"Those of you who are not afraid of the
evening air could go out on to the terrace or
into the garden."</p>

<p>Gisèle de la Balue, a big, tall girl, built on the
model of the statues round the Place de la Concorde,
and who liked to affect free and easy tom-boyish
manners, started off out-doors, running
along heavily and calling out:</p>

<p>"Whoever cares for me will follow me!"</p>

<p>Hubert de Bernès followed her out of politeness.</p>

<p>Rueille, Henry de Bracieux, Pierrot, and M.
Giraud turned with one accord toward Denyse.</p>

<p>"Are you coming, Bijou?" asked Pierrot.</p>

<p>She saw Jean de Blaye talking to Madame de
Nézel, who was just going out with him, and she
answered:</p>

<p>"I will come to you directly. I am going to
see if the children are in bed just now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," proposed the abbé, "I can
spare you the trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; thank you very much, monsieur, but
you know I never feel quite happy if I have not
kissed Fred."</p>

<p>She went out by the door opposite the terrace.</p>

<p>"Your grand-daughter is decidedly the most
charming girl I have ever come across," remarked
M. de Clagny to the marchioness, and then he
added sadly; "It is when an old man meets
women like that, that he regrets his age."</p>

<p>"I must say," answered Madame de Bracieux,
laughing, "that even if you were young, you would
not be just the husband I dream of for Bijou."</p>

<p>"And why not, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Well, because you are, or at least you were,
rather&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;rather large-hearted."</p>

<p>"Large-hearted! good heavens, yes, I was! but
that was the fault of those who did not know how
to keep my affection. I assure you, though, that
with a wife like Bijou, I should never have been
what you call <i>large-hearted</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," said Madame de Bracieux
incredulously, "one never knows."</p>

<p>On leaving the drawing-room, Bijou crossed the
hall, and instead of going up the wide staircase
which led to the children's rooms, she lifted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
old green tapestry curtain which covered the door
of the butler's pantry. Just as she was going to
open this door she turned back into the hall to
get a long, dark cloak, which was hanging there.
It was a Berck fisherwoman's cloak, which she
always put on when it rained. She wrapped herself
up in it hastily, and then went into the pantry,
where it was now quite dark. From the kitchen
she could hear the loud voices of the servants,
who were at dinner. Denyse went across to the
open window, got up on to a chair, and then
gathering her skirts closely round her, stepped out
on to the window-sill, and jumped lightly down
into the garden.</p>

<p>Once there, she hesitated an instant. The terrace
seemed to stand out distinctly, lighted up by the
drawing-room windows. In the chestnut avenue
she could distinguish in the shade the red gleam
of cigars.</p>

<p>Suddenly she pulled the hood of her cloak up
over her head, and evidently making up her mind,
started off quickly along the dark pathway which
led to the other avenue.</p>

<p>During this time her faithful admirers were waiting
on the terrace for her to come and join them
as she had promised, and the ponderous Gisèle
was endeavouring vainly to organise a game at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hide-and-seek. The men seemed to have no
energy; Madame de Tourville was afraid of spoiling
her dress; and Madame de Juzencourt was
strolling about with Jean de Blaye and Madame
de Nézel. Presently, however, she went back to
the others alone, and Mademoiselle de la Balue
wanted to persuade her to have a game, but she
refused emphatically. She certainly was not going
to run about, she said, considering that she was
too warm already with only walking; she had
just had to leave Thérèse de Nézel and Jean de
Blaye, for she could not walk another step.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, Jean and Madame de Nézel
continued strolling along, she in a natural, unaffected
way, going on with the conversation they
had commenced, and he absent-minded and ill-at-ease.</p>

<p>"Why do you not reproach me?" he said at
last, abruptly, not able to contain himself any
longer; "why do you not say all the bad things
you think about me?"</p>

<p>"Because I have nothing to reproach you for,"
she answered, very gently; "and I do not think any
bad things about you."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you do not care about me any
longer."</p>

<p>"I do not care about you any longer?" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
said, and there was an accent of such intense grief
in her voice that he was quite overcome by it.</p>

<p>He knew so well how deeply she loved him, that
he dreaded the thought of the awful suffering she
would have to endure if he were to be quite
straightforward with her now, and so, out of affection
for her, he endeavoured to conceal from her
the real truth.</p>

<p>"Yes," he began, improvising with difficulty an
excuse of which he had not thought until that
moment, "you must have fancied that I was not
thinking of you, for you have been here at The
Pines a fortnight, and I have not sent you a line.
The fact is, it is very difficult to arrange to meet
here at Pont-sur-Loire; everyone knows me here,
and, you see, for your sake, I scarcely liked to ask
you to meet me in the town."</p>

<p>She did not make any reply, and he could not
understand her silence.</p>

<p>"Why do you not answer me?" he asked at
length.</p>

<p>"Why? well, because you are telling me now
exactly the opposite to what you said when you
asked me to accept the Juzencourts' invitation."</p>

<p>"What did I say?" he asked, slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p>"You said that at Pont-sur-Loire it would be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
easy to meet. You said that between the hours of
luncheon and dinner there were two trains up and
two down from The Pines to Pont-sur-Loire, and
that I could get away so easily, as the Juzencourts
never went out except to pay calls at the various
country-houses in the neighbourhood, or to follow
the paper chases. On my arrival here I found that
all these details were perfectly exact."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it really is not so easy as I had
imagined."</p>

<p>"Ah, Jean! instead of trying to deceive me in
this way, it would be much better to tell me the
truth."</p>

<p>"And the truth, according to you, is that I no
longer care for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a part of the truth."</p>

<p>"And," he asked, somewhat uneasily, "the rest?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is, that you are in love with Mademoiselle de
Courtaix. Ah, do not deny it! it is so evident!"
And then, after a moment's silence, she added:
"And so natural!"</p>

<p>"Do you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to forgive. I have never
demanded anything from you, and you have never,
never promised me anything. When I first began
to care for you, I was not a widow; you must
therefore have judged me severely, as a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
nearly always does judge the woman who is weak
enough to care for him when she ought not to."</p>

<p>"I swear to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, do not swear anything; you had all the
more reason to judge me in that way, because I
did not think it my duty to tell you what my life
had been like until then. You doubtless believed
that my husband was kind and affectionate, and
that I endured no remorse, when I allowed myself
to love you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did not think about it at all, I simply adored
you," he said. And then hesitating, and with
evident anxiety, he continued: "And now you
will never care for me any more?"</p>

<p>"What!" she exclaimed, perfectly amazed at
the unconscious selfishness of the man, "you wish
me to go on caring for you?"</p>

<p>"You ask if I wish it? why, what would become
of me without you? you who are my very life!"
And then, as she moved back a step or two in
sheer bewilderment, he went on: "Well, but whatever
have you been imagining?&mdash;that I am going
to marry Bijou, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes."</p>

<p>He was about to explain to her why he could
not marry his cousin, but it occurred to him that
the very prosaic reason for the impossibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
such a match, would make his return to Madame
de Nézel, of whom he was really very fond, appear
as a slight to her.</p>

<p>"It has only been a passing fancy that I have
had for Bijou," he said. "How could I help it? it
is simply impossible to be always with her and to
escape being intoxicated by her beauty, and by her
unconscious and innocent coquetry. For the last
fortnight I have been a fool&mdash;I am still, in fact; but
on seeing you again I knew at once that it is
you only whom I love, and belong to&mdash;heart and
soul."</p>

<p>As he said this, he drew Madame de Nézel's
pale face against his shoulder, and, bending down,
pressed his lips to hers, and then, as the young
widow nestled closer still in his arms, he said, with
passionate tenderness:</p>

<p>"How do you think that I could ever care for
that child&mdash;with whom I am always so reserved&mdash;in
the way I care for you?" He could feel her
slender form trembling in his embrace, and, drawing
her closer still, he murmured: "Forgive me,
darling, you are always so good, and if I have
sinned, it has only been in thought."</p>

<p>"You know I love you," she answered. "But we
must go back to the house at once; they will think
our walk is lasting a long time."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame de Juzencourt, who was seated on the
terrace, called out as soon as she caught sight of
them:</p>

<p>"Well, have you been walking all this time?"</p>

<p>And at the same moment M. de Rueille called
out to Bijou, who had just appeared at one of the
windows:</p>

<p>"So that's the way you come out to us! It's
very kind of you."</p>

<p>"I could not come before," she answered, stepping
out, and then approaching her cousin, she
added, in a low voice: "I had to see to the tea
and the ices, etc., etc.; you must not be vexed
with me."</p>

<p>"Vexed with you!" exclaimed Pierrot warmly.
"Could anyone be vexed with <i>you</i>, now?"</p>

<p>Bijou did not answer. She was watching
Hubert de Bernès in an absent-minded way, as he
stood talking to Bertrade, and she was wondering
how it was that he was so cool in his manner towards
herself. He was polite, certainly, and even
pleasant, but <i>only</i> polite and pleasant, and she
was not accustomed to such moderation. M. de
Clagny appeared presently at one of the windows
and called out:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Bijou, your grandmamma wants
you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Denyse ran into the house, her silk skirts rustling
as she went. She did not even stay to answer
young La Balue, who, pointing to Henry de
Bracieux as he stood with the light showing up
his profile, had just remarked:</p>

<p>"What a handsome man Henry is."</p>

<p>"Bijou," said the marchioness, "I want you to
sing something for us."</p>

<p>"Oh! grandmamma, please"&mdash;she began, in a
beseeching tone, and looking annoyed.</p>

<p>"M. de Clagny wants to hear you," said
Madame de Bracieux, insisting.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then, I will, certainly," replied
Bijou pleasantly, without taking into account that
her way of consenting was not very flattering for
the rest of her grandmother's guests.</p>

<p>She went to the piano, and, taking up a guitar,
put the pink ribbon which was attached to it round
her neck, and then came back and took up her
position in the midst of the semi-circle formed by
the arm-chairs.</p>

<p>"I am going to accompany myself with the
guitar," she said; "it is simpler." And then turning
to M. de Clagny, she asked: "What do you want
me to sing? Do you like the old-fashioned
songs?" and without waiting for a reply, she
began the ballad of the "Petit Soldat":<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Je me suis engagé</span><br />
<span class="i0">l'amour d'une blonde."</span><br />
</div>

<p>She had a good ear and a pretty voice, which she
used skilfully, and it was with plaintive sweetness
that she sang the touching story of the young
soldier who "veut qu'on mette son c&#339;ur dans une
serviette blanche."</p>

<p>The drawing-room soon filled when Bijou began
to sing, and the various expressions on the different
faces were most amusing to see.</p>

<p>Jean was listening in a nervous, excited way,
pulling his fair moustache irritably through his
fingers.</p>

<p>M. de Rueille, affected in spite of himself by the
doleful air, and annoyed that all these people
should be admiring Bijou, was pacing up and down
at the other end of the drawing-room, pretending
not to be listening to the music.</p>

<p>Pierrot, with his mouth open, was all attention.
Young La Balue, with his elbow resting on a side-table
in an awkward and ridiculous pose, kept his
colourless eyes fixed on the young girl in a gaze
which he tried to make magnetic, and with such
bold persistency that Henry de Bracieux felt the
most extraordinary desire to walk up to him and
box his ears. Even Abbé Courteil was carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
away by the plaintive ballad; he was deeply
moved, and sat there with his eyes stretched wide
open, breathing heavily. Hubert de Bernès only
was listening with polite attention, but comparative
indifference. As to the ladies, all, except, perhaps,
Gisèle de la Balue, admired Bijou sincerely.</p>

<p>Madame de Nézel was listening with a mournful
expression in her eyes, and a kind-hearted smile,
whilst as for M. de Clagny, it was as though all
the sensitiveness and affection of his nature had
gone out towards this pretty, fragile-looking, young
creature. His eyes, beaming with tenderness,
seemed to take in at the same time, the beautiful
face, the little rosy fingers as they touched the
strings of the guitar, and the slender, supple figure.</p>

<p>When Bijou had come to the end of her
song, she went up to him, without paying any
attention to the compliments that were being
showered on her, and, in a pretty, coaxing way,
she asked:</p>

<p>"It did not bore you too much, I hope?"</p>

<p>M. de Clagny could not answer for a moment.
He felt choked with emotion.</p>

<p>"I shall often ask you for that song again,"
he said at last. "Yes, I shall come often, and
you will sing me the 'Petit Soldat,' won't you?"</p>

<p>He had a great desire to hear Bijou sing for him&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
him alone; he did not want to share her voice
and her charm with all these people whom he now
detested.</p>

<p>"You shall come as often as you please," she
answered, looking delighted, "and I will sing you
everything you like," and then gliding away she
went across to Jean de Blaye, who was standing
alone at the other end of the drawing-room. "It
annoys you when I sing, doesn't it?" she asked
him.</p>

<p>"Why, no!" he answered, surprised at the
question, and surprised that Bijou should trouble
about him. "Why should you think so?"</p>

<p>"Because I saw you just now&mdash;you were pulling
your moustache in the most furious way, and you
looked bored to death. Yes, you certainly did
look bored!"</p>

<p>"It was just your own imagination."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! it was not just my imagination.
When I care about anyone I am always very
clear-sighted! so, you see, it is quite the contrary.
Why are you frowning now?"</p>

<p>"I am not frowning."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you were, and it looks as though what
I said just now had vexed you, too."</p>

<p>"What did you just say?"</p>

<p>"That I am very clear-sighted. And you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
vexed, because you are afraid that I shall see that
something is the matter."</p>

<p>"Something the matter?" he asked uneasily.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What is it? Ah! I don't know! But most
certainly something is the matter with you&mdash;you
are not at all like yourself ever since&mdash;why, ever
since we have been at Bracieux."</p>

<p>"Really?" he said, putting on a joking tone.
"I am different, am I&mdash;and the most extraordinary
thing is, that I did not know myself about this
difference."</p>

<p>Bijou shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>

<p>"Don't try to take me in like that, Jean, my
dear; I know you too well, you see. You are
different, I tell you! You have gradually got
very abrupt, restless, and absent-minded. Listen,
now,&mdash;would you like me to tell you what it
is?"</p>

<p>Seated at some distance away from them,
Madame de Nézel was watching them, with an
expression of melancholy resignation.</p>

<p>Bijou glanced across at her, and the young
girl's violet eyes gleamed between her long, thick
lashes, as she said:</p>

<p>"You are in love with someone who does not
return your love."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean de Blaye coloured up furiously.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you are talking about,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"Well, then, why have you gone so red? Oh,
how proud you are. You are vexed because I
have found this out." And then, after a short
silence, she began again: "Have you told her?"</p>

<p>"Have I told what? and whom? My dear
Bijou, how foolish you are."</p>

<p>"Have you told Mad&mdash;" She stopped abruptly,
and then, with her face turned towards Madame
de Nézel, she continued: "The person with whom
you are in love, have you told her that you love
her?"</p>

<p>"No!" he murmured, in a stifled sort of voice.</p>

<p>"You are afraid to? but why? I constantly
hear grandmamma, Bertrade, Paul, and Uncle
Alexis, saying over and over again that you are
the kind of man women like; <i>she</i> would be sure to
like you, too, and she would marry you, I am
certain." She leaned towards him, nearly touching
his ear as she whispered to him, and not caring
what effect her familiarity might have. "Listen,
now, if you like I will tell her for you, and I am
quite sure what her answer will be."</p>

<p>Jean rose abruptly, and seizing Bijou's hand, he
asked excitedly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"I am just saying that she <i>will</i> love you, if she
does not already."</p>

<p>"But of whom are you speaking&mdash;of whom?"
he stammered out, aghast.</p>

<p>She answered him in a hesitating way, with a
frank look on her pretty face, but she spoke in such
a low voice that he could scarcely catch her first
words.</p>

<p>"I am speaking of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bijou!" called out Pierrot, separating them
unceremoniously, "grandmamma says you are forgetting
about the tea." And then, looking at their
faces, he went on: "Well, I never! you are both
as red as cherries; there's no mistake about it, it's
baking hot in here."</p>

<p>Denyse hurried away, and Pierrot continued:</p>

<p>"We thought over there that you were quarrelling."</p>

<p>"Ah! you thought that, did you?" answered
Jean, by way of saying something.</p>

<p>"Yes, especially grandmamma; that's why she
sent me to tell Bijou about the tea. I say, Bijou
isn't worried about anything, is she?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, what kind of worry do you fancy
she could have, my dear fellow?" And then, with
a smile, he added: "Who do you imagine would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
undertake to cause her any worry? It seems to
me that anyone who did venture to would have a
bad time of it in this house."</p>

<p>"She's so sweet, and so nice always," answered
the boy, with great warmth. "As for me, why, I
just adore her; and Paul does, too, and so does
Henry, and M. Giraud, and Bertrade's kids, and
the abbé, and everyone, in fact; even little La
Balue is gone on her, and he's never gone on anyone.
Yes, he was telling her I don't know what
up in a corner of the room after dinner, and then,
when she was singing&mdash;did you ever see such eyes
as he was making at her?&mdash;oh, no! if you had only
just seen him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do shut up!" exclaimed Jean irritably, "you
wear everyone out, if you only knew it, my dear
Pierrot."</p>

<p>When Bijou came back to the drawing-room,
Henry de Bracieux waylaid her.</p>

<p>"I say," he began, in a cross-grained tone, "what
was La Balue telling you just now that appeared
to be so interesting?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Here, after dinner."</p>

<p>"Here?" repeated Bijou, apparently trying to
recall something to her memory, "after dinner?
Ah, I remember; why, he was talking about you!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"About me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, about you! He thinks you are very
handsome, but he also thinks that you do not
know how to make the most of your good
looks."</p>

<p>"Have you finished making game of me?"</p>

<p>"I assure you that I am not making game of
you&mdash;not the least bit in the world. He even
advised me to tell you that instead of your frightful
stand-up collars&mdash;these are his words, you know,
and not mine&mdash;you ought to wear&mdash;what did he
call them now?&mdash;oh, Van Dyck collars, which would
not cover your neck up, for it appears that your
throat is superb, and your head so well set on your
shoulders; and then you have lovely teeth! I only
wish you could hear him sing the praises of your
personal appearance."</p>

<p>"Of my personal appearance! Mine?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; you thought, perhaps, that he was
talking to me of mine? Not at all! He informed
me, too, that he was going to tell you all that in
poetry; not the Van Dyck collars, but the rest."</p>

<p>"That young man is an idiot!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, he is very harmless."</p>

<p>"You are so good-hearted always, you never dig
into anyone. Ah, attention! they are packing up,
the La Balue crew!" And Henry, in a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
voice, and apparently delighted, finished up with a
"Hip! hip! hurrah!"</p>

<p>M. de la Balue, who was just coming out of the
hall with a heap of cloaks, looked at him in
astonishment, while at the doorway a little family
quarrel took place. The good man wanted to
make his wife and daughter wrap their heads up in
some very ordinary-looking knitted shawls, so that
they should not get a chill. He was obliged, however,
to give in at last.</p>

<p>Bijou, on saying good-bye to Madame de Nézel,
held out her little hand, and looked straight into
her eyes with such an expression of innocent curiosity
that the young widow turned away, quite
confused by the persistency of the young girl's
gaze. It seemed to her as though this child had
discovered the secret of her life, and the bare idea
of this caused her intense misery.</p>

<p>Bijou's charm, however, was so great, and her
power of attraction so strong, that Madame de
Nézel, at the bottom of her heart, felt nothing but
affection for the lovely little creature who had so
unconsciously stolen her happiness from her.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Denyse gaily, when she
went back into the drawing-room, where only M.
de Clagny and the family now remained, "it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
half-past twelve, you know; they all seemed like
fixtures, and I thought they were never going to
leave us!"</p>

<p>"The La Balue family are not very handsome,"
remarked the abbé.</p>

<p>"Oh, they are not so bad," protested the young
girl; "it is only a question of getting used to
them, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Young Balue is horrible!" said Madame de
Bracieux. "And then, too, there is something
snaky about him. When you shake hands with
him, it is like touching an eel."</p>

<p>"And the daughter, too!" put in Pierrot. "Ugh,
she has such little pig's eyes! and Louis, too, has
little eyes!"</p>

<p>"They are very nice, though, all the same," said
Bijou, in a conciliatory tone.</p>

<p>"And they come of very good family," added
Madame de Bracieux; "they are descended from
La Balue, from the Cardinal, the real&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," put in Bijou gently, "it would, perhaps,
be better for Gisèle not to have descended
from the iron cage, but to have larger eyes; however,
as it cannot be helped&mdash;"</p>

<p>M. de Clagny laughed, as he turned round to
look about for his hat, which he had put down
somewhere in the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"One needs to have a certain amount of assurance,"
he said, "in making one's exit from here, for
one feels how one will be pulled to pieces."</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid," said Bijou, "we shall
not pull you to pieces, although you could stand it
very well. I promise you, though, that you shall
not be pulled to pieces. Will you take my word
for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will take your word," answered the count,
as he took the little hands, which were held out to
him, and pressed them affectionately in his.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Are</span> you going for a ride, Bijou?" called out
Pierrot, leaning out of the window.</p>

<p>Denyse, who was just crossing the courtyard,
pointed to her riding-habit.</p>

<p>"Well, you can be sure that in this heat I should
not entertain myself by walking about in a cloth
dress if I were not going to ride."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"So that we can come and meet you&mdash;we two&mdash;M.
Giraud and I,&mdash;at eleven o'clock!"</p>

<p>Just behind Pierrot the tutor's head was to be
seen.</p>

<p>"I am going to The Borderettes to take a
message to Lavenue," answered Bijou; and then,
seeing Giraud, she said pleasantly: "Good morning.
I shall see you again, then, soon?"</p>

<p>Patatras was waiting in the shade. The old
coachman, who always accompanied Bijou, helped
her into her saddle, and then, mounting in his turn,
prepared to follow her. When Pierrot saw this, he
called out again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"How is it that none of the cousins are riding
with you?"</p>

<p>"I did not tell them that I was going out."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed regretfully, "if I were only
free, wouldn't I come with you!"</p>

<p>She turned round in her saddle, with an easy
movement which showed that she was not laced in
at all, and answered Pierrot, with a merry laugh:</p>

<p>"I should not have told you though, either!"</p>

<p>As soon as Bijou had passed through the gateway,
she put Patatras to a gallop, for the flies were
teasing him dreadfully.</p>

<p>She went along through the hot air, meeting the
sun, the burning rays of which fell full on her
pretty face without making it red. She did not
slacken her pace until she arrived at the narrow
lane leading to The Borderettes. It was almost
perpendicular, and covered with loose stones, and at
the bottom of the little valley, which was very
green, in spite of the dry season, the farm, with its
white walls and red roof, looked like a perfectly
new toy-house. When she was at the bottom of the
hill, Bijou pulled out of her pocket a little looking-glass,
and then arranged her veil and the loose
curly locks of hair, which had blown over her ears
and the back of her neck. She then gathered from
the hedge a spray of mulberry blossom, which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
fastened in the bodice of her habit, arranged the
little handkerchief, trimmed with Valenciennes,
daintily in her side-pocket, and then, after another
short gallop, pulled up at the entrance to the farm.</p>

<p>A rough voice called out: "Are you there,
master?" and then a young farm labourer came
out of the house, saying: "Master ain't heard me
call; I'll go and find him."</p>

<p>A minute or two later, a tall young man, of some
thirty-five years of age, appeared. He was a true
type of the Norman peasant, somewhat meagre-looking,
with fair hair, and a slight stoop. He
looked very warm and was out of breath. His
face was so red that it seemed to be turning
purple.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, trying to get his breath
again, "it's you, Mad'moiselle Denyse, it's you, is
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur Lavenue," she answered, smiling,
"it is."</p>

<p>"Won't you get down?" he asked, holding out
his hand to help her.</p>

<p>"No, thanks! I have only come to bring you a
message from grandmamma. It is about the Confirmation
dinner next Monday; but you know all
about that, as you are the mayor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know about it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, grandmamma would like to have some
very nice peaches for Monday, and some very nice
pears; in fact, all kinds of nice things, such as grow
in your orchard."</p>

<p>"They shall bring you them, Mad'moiselle
Denyse! You can be quite easy about that.
I'll see they are well chosen." And then, as the
young girl turned her horse round, he said, as he
watched her, almost dazed with admiration: "Are
you going to start back already, mad'moiselle?
Won't you stop and have some refreshment&mdash;a
bowl of milk now? I know you like a drop o'
good milk!" And then, in a persuasive tone, he
added, as he took hold of Patatras' bridle, "That
'ud give the horse a rest, too; he's very warm
after the run."</p>

<p>Farmer Lavenue's way of talking always amused
Bijou. It had been more than ten years now since
the sturdy Norman had emigrated to Touraine, and
yet he had not lost his strong Norman accent in
the slightest degree.</p>

<p>It was Madame de Bracieux, who, thoroughly
dissatisfied with the Touraine farmers, had taken
up this man. Charlemagne Lavenue had never
fraternised with the regular inhabitants of the
place. He was looked up to and admired by the
simple-minded and unskilful villagers, who saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
him making money in the very place where others
had been ruined. He had, by "sending for people
from his part of the world," gradually transformed
The Borderettes into a small Normandy, and he
had so much influence now in the place that he,
an interloper, had been elected mayor of Bracieux,
to the exclusion of the former notables of the
place.</p>

<p>As Denyse did not reply, he lifted her down
from her horse, saying as he did so: "You will,
mad'moiselle, won't you?" And then, after giving
the reins to the old groom, he led the way to the
door of the farm, and stood aside for Bijou to
enter.</p>

<p>"How nice it is here, Monsieur Lavenue," she
exclaimed, in a pleasant way. "Have I ever seen
this room before? No, I don't think I have!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you've seen it, mad'moiselle, only, you
know, it's been fresh white-washed, and, you see,
that makes it different-like."</p>

<p>"When you are married, now," she said, smiling,
"it will be very nice, indeed."</p>

<p>Farmer Lavenue, who was looking at Bijou with
hungry eyes, held his head up erect, and then,
shaking it slowly, he answered, with some hesitation:</p>

<p>"I can't decide to give the farm a mistress,
because I don't come across one as suits me." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
after a moment's silence, he added: "That is to
say, amongst them as I could have."</p>

<p>"Why, how's that? any of the girls from Bracieux,
or Combes, or from the villages round The Borderettes,
would marry you, Monsieur Lavenue, and
there are some very pretty girls among them."</p>

<p>"I can't see as they are," he answered, blushing,
and twisting about in his fingers the huge, broad-brimmed
hat which he always wore the whole year
round.</p>

<p>"You are difficult to please, then; do you mean
that you don't think Catherine Lebour pretty?"</p>

<p>"No, Mad'moiselle Denyse."</p>

<p>"Nor Josephine Lacaille?"</p>

<p>"No, Mad'moiselle Denyse."</p>

<p>"And Louise Pature?"</p>

<p>"No, mad'moiselle."</p>

<p>Bijou laughed merrily. "Oh, well, do you mean
to say that you don't admire any woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;there's <i>one</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" she asked, looking full at the
peasant, with her frank, innocent expression.</p>

<p>Lavenue turned redder still, and stooped down
with an awkward movement to pick up his hat,
which had fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>"I can't say," he stuttered out; "she isn't for
such as me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Bijou did not hear his reply. With her pretty
figure slightly bent, and her head thrown back, she
was slowly drinking a second cup of milk, whilst
the farmer, who had recovered himself, stood still,
with his eyes wide open, gazing at this fragile-looking
young creature in timid, half-fearful admiration.</p>

<p>When Bijou had finished her milk, she looked at
him critically, with a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"My goodness! how warm it is to-day," he said,
wiping with the back of his hand the great drops
of perspiration, which stood out on his forehead.</p>

<p>"Thank you, so much, Monsieur Lavenue," said
Denyse, getting up; "your milk is delicious."</p>

<p>"Oh! but you aren't surely going to start off
again already?" he said, with a downcast look.</p>

<p>"Already! why, I have been here at least a
quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Oh, well! it's been precious quick to me that
quarter of an hour!" he stammered; and then, in a
lower voice, he added: "Thank you, very much,
Mad'moiselle Denyse, for the honour as you've
done me. I sha'n't forget it, that's certain!"</p>

<p>On getting up, Bijou had let the flowers, which
she was wearing in her bodice, fall to the
ground.</p>

<p>As she turned towards the door, to see whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the horses were there, the peasant, with a stealthy
movement, stretched his long, sinewy body out
along the floor, and, snatching up the flowers, hid
them away under his blouse.</p>

<p>The groom was about to descend from his horse
in order to help Denyse to mount; but she made a
sign to stop him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lavenue will help me on to my
horse," she said; "he is very strong."</p>

<p>She put her foot out in order to place it in the
farmer's hand; but, without any warning, he put
his hands round her waist, and then, steadying her
a second against himself, he lifted her straight into
the saddle.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" she exclaimed, in amazement, "I
said you were strong, but however could you hold
me at arm's length like that, and put me on to my
horse, which is so tall?" and then, as he did not
speak, but just stood there, looking down and
breathing heavily, she added: "There, you see, I
was too heavy! You are quite out of breath."</p>

<p>She started off before he had time to answer,
calling out to him as she rode away:</p>

<p>"Good morning, and thank you again, very
much!"</p>

<p>Just as she was turning out of the farmyard, she
looked round again at the farmer, who was standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
motionless, as though rooted to the spot, with
his arms hanging down at his sides.</p>

<p>"Don't forget grandmamma's peaches and pears,
Monsieur Lavenue!" she called out.</p>

<p>She then looked at her watch, and found that
it was five minutes past eleven. She had plenty of
time to return home without hurrying, and then,
too, M. Giraud and Pierrot were to meet her, and
they were never free until eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>As she passed through a village, she gathered a
spray of clematis from the cemetery wall to replace
the flowers which she had dropped, and then,
when she found herself quite alone, she took out
her little looking-glass again, and fluffed her hair
up, as it was not curly enough now that the heat
had made it limp. At half-past eleven, as she saw
no signs of those whom she was expecting, she
began to get impatient, and put her horse to a
gallop, for Patatras was getting tired, and would
keep stopping, and doing his utmost to browse the
leaves along the hedges.</p>

<p>Suddenly a serious, almost melancholy, expression
came over the girl's pretty, happy-looking
face. She was just crossing a meadow, which was
skirted by a wood.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Bijou! that's how you cut us, is it?"
exclaimed a voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped short, looking surprised, and turned
back a few steps.</p>

<p>Pierrot and M. Giraud, who had been lying down
in the shade, rose from the ground, leaving the long
grass marked with their impress.</p>

<p>"Why, you are here already!" she said; "I did
not expect to meet you so far away from home; at
what time did you start, then?"</p>

<p>"A little before the hour," answered Pierrot;
and then he added slily, winking at his tutor:
"M'sieu' Giraud was a brick; he let me off a bit
earlier&mdash;without me begging much, either&mdash;and
now, if we want to be at Bracieux at twelve o'clock,
we shall have to put our best feet first!"</p>

<p>They were walking along by the side of Bijou.</p>

<p>"Have you recovered from yesterday evening?"
she asked, addressing M. Giraud.</p>

<p>"Recovered?" said the young tutor. "How
<i>recovered</i>?"</p>

<p>"Because you could not have enjoyed yourself
very much! M. de Tourville and M. de Juzencourt
blocked you up, one after the other, in a
corner, to explain to you: the one that Charles de
Tourville embarked with William the Conqueror in
1066; and the other, that a Juzencourt fought
against Charles the Bold in 1477 under the walls
of Nancy. Am I not right?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite right! and M. de Juzencourt added that
there was only blue blood in his family. I did not
quite understand why he should tell me that."</p>

<p>"In order to prove to you that, traced clearly
only since 1477, but without the slightest <i>mésalliance</i>,
the Juzencourts are more respectable than
the Tourvilles."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, M. de Tourville married a young lady who
was all very well, but her name was Chaillot, and
her father is on the Stock Exchange; you see,
therefore, that, as regards the Tourvilles, the
family is older than the Juzencourt family, but
it is not so pure. You managed to put such
a good face on as you listened to all that. Oh,
dear! I could have laughed if you had not looked
so wretched."</p>

<p>"It wasn't just the nuisance of having to listen
to the Tourville and Juzencourt yarns that made
him look like that," observed Pierrot. "For some
time past he is always like that, even with me, and
I can promise you that I don't overpower him with
yarns, either about Charles the Bold or William
the Conqueror."</p>

<p>"I am quite convinced on that score!" said
Bijou, laughing.</p>

<p>"Dear me! it isn't that there'd be any difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
about it," protested Pierrot. "I <i>could</i> very well if
I wanted to, but&mdash;confound it!"</p>

<p>"Confound it! again?" said the young tutor,
annoyed, and looking reproachfully at his pupil.
"You know that M. de Jonzac objects to your
speaking in that way. He particularly wishes you
to be more careful, and more correct, in your
choice of words."</p>

<p>"Oh, well! if he were to talk to my friends, he'd
hear a few things, and he'd soon get used to it, too.
It's always like that; just a matter of getting used
to things."</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine that very well, though," said
Bijou; "Uncle Alexis letting himself get used to
the style of conversation of your friends."</p>

<p>She drew up whilst she was speaking, and
pointed to something in the wood.</p>

<p>"Oh! look at that beautiful mountain ash, isn't
it red? How pretty those bunches are!"</p>

<p>"Do you want some of those berries?" proposed
Pierrot.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should like some, they are so beautiful."</p>

<p>The youth entered the coppice, and they heard
the branches snapping as he broke them in order
to make himself a passage, and presently the top
of the red tree shook and swayed, now bending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
down, and now springing up again, as Pierrot
shook it roughly.</p>

<p>Bijou, with her head bent, and a far-away look
in her eyes, seemed to be in a dream, quite oblivious
of what was going on around her. She started
on hearing Pierrot's voice as he called out to her
to know whether he was to gather a large bunch.</p>

<p>"There is nothing worrying you, is there, mademoiselle?"
asked Monsieur Giraud timidly, as he
stroked Patatras gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you do not seem quite like yourself;
you look rather sad."</p>

<p>"Sad?" she said, forcing a smile. "I look
sad?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Just now, when you passed by without
seeing us, you looked sad, very sad, and now
again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just now&mdash;that's quite possible. Yes, I did
not feel quite gay; but, now, why, I have no
reason to be otherwise&mdash;quite the contrary. I feel
so happy here, in this velvety-looking field, and
with this beautiful sunshine that I love so much!"
And then she added, as though in a dream, and
not taking any notice of the young man: "Yes, I
am so happy, I should like to stay like this for
ever and ever."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>She pressed her rosy lips to the spray of
clematis with which she had been playing the last
minute or two, and then put it back into her
bodice, not seeing the hand which Giraud was
holding out beseechingly towards the poor flowers,
which were already withering.</p>

<p>Pierrot came out of the thicket at this moment,
carrying an immense bunch of mountain ash
berries. Bijou was smiling again by this
time.</p>

<p>"You are ever so kind, Pierrot dear," she said,
after thanking him, "and all the more so as you
will have the bother of carrying that for another
mile yet."</p>

<p>"Oh! if it would give you any pleasure, you
know, I'd do things that were a lot more bother
than that!"</p>

<p>"You are good, Pierrot."</p>

<p>"It isn't because I'm good;" he said, and then
coming nearer, so that he touched the horse, he
added very softly: "It's because I'm so fond of
you."</p>

<p>Bijou did not answer, and in another minute
Pierrot began again:</p>

<p>"How well you sang last night. Didn't she,
M'sieu' Giraud?"</p>

<p>"Wonderfully well," said the tutor. "And what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a lovely voice! so fresh, and so pure. I can
understand something now which I did not understand
yesterday."</p>

<p>"What may that be?"</p>

<p>"The infinite power of the voice! Yes, before
hearing you I did not know what I know at present.
You will sing again, will you not, mademoiselle?
Fancy, I have been here three weeks,
and I had never had the happiness of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will give you <i>that happiness</i> as much as ever
you like."</p>

<p>She was joking again now, for the little dreamy
creature of a minute before was Bijou once more.</p>

<p>As they approached the château, she put her
hand up to shade her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, what's going on?" she said; "the hall-door
steps look black with people."</p>

<p>"Hang it!" exclaimed Pierrot crossly. "They
are all out there watching for you! There's Paul,
and there's Henry, and the abbé, and Uncle
Alexis, and Bertrade. Look, though! Who's
that? You are right&mdash;there are some other folks
too. Ah! it's old Dubuisson, and Jeanne, and
then there's a fellow I don't know; a fellow all in
black. Oh, well! he must be a shivery sort to
come to the country dressed in black, in such
heat as this."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it's M. Spiegel, Jeanne's <i>fiancé</i>. They
were to bring him."</p>

<p>"Yes, that must be it! I say, he doesn't look a
very lively sort, your Jeanne's <i>fiancé</i>. She isn't
though either&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bijou was looking round to see what had become
of Giraud, who had suddenly become so
silent. He was following the young girl, worshipping
her as he walked along as though she were
some idol.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, whilst Pierrot was very
much taken up with looking in the direction of
the château, the little bunch of clematis dropped
from Bijou's dress, and fell at the tutor's feet. He
picked it up quickly, and slipped it into his pocket-book,
after kissing it, with a kind of passionate
devotion, whilst behind him, the old groom, silent
and correct as usual, laughed to himself.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">M. Dubuisson</span>, whom the students called "Old
Dubuisson," was the principal of the college.</p>

<p>He had brought his daughter to Bracieux, where
she was to spend a week with Bijou, and Jeanne's
<i>fiancé</i>, a young professor, newly appointed at the
Pont-sur-Loire College, had accompanied them.</p>

<p>"How warm you must be, my dear Bijou,"
called out the marchioness, appearing at one of
the windows.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, grandmamma," answered Denyse, taking
M. de Rueille's hand in order to descend from
her horse. "M. Giraud and Pierrot must be
warm&mdash;I am all right."</p>

<p>She kissed Jeanne heartily, spoke to M. Dubuisson,
and then looked in a hesitating way towards
the young professor, who was contemplating her in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Bijou, this is Monsieur Spiegel," said Mademoiselle
Dubuisson.</p>

<p>With a graceful, pretty movement, which was
very taking, Bijou held out her little hand to the
young man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are friends at once," she said; and
then, as she moved away with Jeanne, she
whispered: "He is charming, you know, quite
charming!"</p>

<p>M. Spiegel perhaps overheard this kindly criticism,
or else it was just by accident that he happened
to turn very red at that moment.</p>

<p>"Go and change your dress quickly, Bijou!"
commanded the marchioness.</p>

<p>"But, grandmamma, I am not warm, really and
truly."</p>

<p>"Come here! Let me see!"</p>

<p>In a docile way, Bijou went up to Madame
de Bracieux.</p>

<p>"Well, grandmamma?" she said, when the
marchioness had satisfied herself by putting her
finger between the young girl's neck and her
collar, "wasn't I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's quite true," said Madame de Bracieux
unwillingly, "she is not warm at all; it is incomprehensible!
Well, stay as you are then, if you
like." She made her grand-daughter turn round
just in front of her, and then remarked, in a
satisfied tone, "You look very well like that.
Those little white, piqué jackets are very becoming."</p>

<p>"They suit Bijou," said Bertrade, "because, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
her complexion, everything suits her; but these
little English jackets are very unbecoming to most
women."</p>

<p>Abbé Courteil looked at the black skirt, the
white jacket, and then at Bijou herself.</p>

<p>"At all events, the black and white together
is perfectly charming. Mademoiselle Denyse
looks like a big swallow."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed the marchioness, with
a benevolent expression in her eyes, "that's very
pretty, now, that comparison!"</p>

<p>Though she herself was the topic of conversation,
Bijou was paying no attention to what was
being said, but was talking in a pleasant way to
M. Spiegel, a little apart from the others.</p>

<p>He was a serious, placid, young man, with a
somewhat rigid expression. His eyes, however,
had a merry twinkle, which relieved the severity of
his mouth, and the austerity of his deportment.</p>

<p>He was rather tall, and slightly made, and was
dressed in dark clothes of a good cut. Altogether
M. Spiegel might have passed for a young clergyman.
Fascinated and almost bewildered by Bijou's
charm and wonderful beauty, he was gazing at
her with a look of surprise and admiration in
his eyes, whilst the young girl, for her part, kept
stealing a glance at him, for she was quite astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to find that Jeanne's <i>fiancé</i> was so satisfactory-looking.</p>

<p>Luncheon seemed to be very long. The
marchioness's guests were all engaged in studying
each other, some of them absent-minded and
silent, and the others talkative, but singularly preoccupied
also.</p>

<p>Madame de Bracieux was witnessing, without
understanding in the least what it all meant, the
change of attitude, or, in fact, the transformation
which had commenced a few days ago. She could
scarcely recognise her little troop with whom she
had hitherto been able to do just as she liked.</p>

<p>M. Spiegel and Bijou, who were placed next to
each other at the table, were the only ones who
talked with the animation of those who have something
to say, and who are not talking for the mere
sake of talking.</p>

<p>Several times Jeanne Dubuisson, seated on the
right of M. Spiegel, turned towards him with a
little flash in her usually soft blue eyes. She was
thinking, sorrowfully, that her <i>fiancé</i> certainly
seemed to prefer looking at Bijou to looking at her,
and a feeling of sadness came over her at the idea
that she had never seen his eyes resting on her
with as much expression in them as there was now
when he gazed at Bijou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeanne, who was nineteen, looked much older
than Denyse, although she was a little like her.
Her hair, which was fair like Bijou's, was less
glossy, and not so auburn, although it was thicker;
her eyes were of a less uncommon blue; her teeth
were as white, but not so regular; her complexion
was less brilliant, and her head not so well set on
her shoulders.</p>

<p>Bijou, who was very short, wore very high heels
in order to look taller, whilst Jeanne, who was tall
enough, always wore flat-heeled boots.</p>

<p>The one fairly dazzled everyone by her wonderful
beauty, whilst the other would pass by almost
unnoticed, her chief claim to prettiness being a
certain charm of expression, which betokened an
unselfish disposition and a kind heart.</p>

<p>After luncheon, Bijou carried Jeanne off with her
to the park which surrounded the château. She
had scarcely seen her friend since her engagement.</p>

<p>"Why," asked Bijou, "did you tell me so calmly
that M. Spiegel was rather good-looking?"</p>

<p>"Well, because I think he is," answered
Mademoiselle Dubuisson. "Do you mean to say
that you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, don't act; you know perfectly
well that he is more than <i>rather</i> good-looking."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, don't you see, from the description you
gave me, I expected to see a nice young man with
a goody sort of look about him&mdash;rather a bore, in
fact&mdash;and then, instead, you bring us a most
delightful man. You ought to have prepared us;
you ought not to give people such shocks&mdash;" And
then, not giving Jeanne time to reply, she
continued: "Where did you meet him?"</p>

<p>"This spring, at Easter, when we went to
Bordeaux to stay with my aunt."</p>

<p>"And it was settled at once."</p>

<p>"No, but I liked him from the first."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are one of the affectionate kind."</p>

<p>"And I soon saw that he, too, liked very much
to be with me."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, we came away, and I felt wretched,
of course. I thought I was mistaken, and that he
did not care about me at all."</p>

<p>"You did not tell me anything about all that."</p>

<p>"No; in the first place I imagined that it was all
over, and then I should not have liked to talk
about it to anyone, not even to you; it seems to
me that, about such matters&mdash;well, when one is in
love, one should only talk about it to one's own
self; that is the only way to be quite understood."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, then, you fancy that I do not understand
anything about love?"</p>

<p>"About love such as I understand it? no! you
are too pretty, you see, and then you are too much
fêted and adored by everyone to be able, as I
have done, to satisfy and content yourself with an
immense affection for one person only."</p>

<p>Bijou sighed, as she said regretfully:</p>

<p>"It must be so happy, though, to love anyone
like that."</p>

<p>"Well, it would be easy enough for you; your
cousin M. de Blaye adores you. Oh, it is no use
denying it&mdash;it is so perfectly evident; I saw it
instantly."</p>

<p>"You are dreaming&mdash;" said Bijou, looking
astounded.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! he is in love with you, madly in
love with you, and he seems to me to be a man
worthy of your love."</p>

<p>"Instead of talking nonsense, finish telling me
the story of your engagement. We had got as far
as where you left Bordeaux, thinking that all was
over. What next?"</p>

<p>"Well, next, a fortnight ago, the professorship
of philosophy was vacant, and papa was surprised
to hear that M. Spiegel had been appointed to it.
'It is a come-down,' he said to me, 'for Pont-sur-Loire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
is not as good as Bordeaux'; but not at all&mdash;it
was no come-down."</p>

<p>"It was he himself, then, who had asked for the
change?"</p>

<p>"Exactly! and last Monday, he and his mother
arrived at our house to ask papa's consent."</p>

<p>"What's his mother like?"</p>

<p>"Very nice, and good-looking still; but she seems
rather severe, a little bit hard."</p>

<p>"Don't take any notice of that; Protestants
always appear like that."</p>

<p>"How do you know that she is a Protestant?"</p>

<p>"Because I suppose that she is of the same
religion as her son."</p>

<p>"But who told you that M. Spiegel is a
Protestant?"</p>

<p>"No one. I discovered that all alone; it did
not take me long either&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how can you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not know anything, and yet you see I do
know all the same; it's a very good thing to be
able to marry a Protestant; they are less frivolous,
more serious, and more constant."</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps so; but his mother, as I told you
looks very severe, very; and she is going to live
with us."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, so much the better. It is a safe-guard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
don't you know, to have a mother with you
who is somewhat austere. In the first place, she
will inspire everyone with respect for you."</p>

<p>"I don't think I need anyone to inspire people
with respect for me, and, anyhow, it seems to me
that if I did, why, my husband would be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all! oh, no! parents are quite different,
and I was brought up to worship my parents, and
to believe that their presence brings not only respect
but happiness into the home."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I think that, too, as regards papa; but
Madame Spiegel is a stranger to me, as it were,
and I do feel that I owe her a little grudge for
coming to intrude on the privacy of our home-life,
which would have seemed so much happier alone."</p>

<p>"You must say to yourself that she is the mother
of your husband, that he loves her, and that you
ought to love her for his sake."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. How I wish I were like
you, Bijou dear! you are so much better than I
am."</p>

<p>"I am an angel, am I not? that's settled."</p>

<p>"You are joking; but it is quite, quite true."</p>

<p>"Tell me, won't it make you miserable to be
away from your <i>fiancé</i> all this week, which you
are going to spend with me?"</p>

<p>"No; besides he will come with papa to see me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
if your grandmamma will allow him to, and then
he is going to Paris for a few days."</p>

<p>"And here I am walking you about, like the
thoughtless creature that I am, forgetting that
the unhappy young man is sure to be wretched
without you. Let us go in; shall we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am quite willing."</p>

<p>A bright gleam suddenly came into Bijou's eyes,
shaded as they were by their long lashes, and then,
putting on an indifferent air, she said to her friend:</p>

<p>"Tell me what little incident could possibly
have given you the extraordinary idea that Jean
de Blaye cares for me?"</p>

<p>"The way he looked at you all through luncheon,
and then, too, his annoyance when we were all out
on the steps this morning watching for you, and
he saw you coming with young Jonzac and his
tutor."</p>

<p>"You have too much imagination."</p>

<p>"No; I am sure that he is in love with you&mdash;and
very much so!&mdash;and what about you?"</p>

<p>"What about me?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you don't care for him?"</p>

<p>"No, not in the way you mean, at least. He is
my cousin; I like him just as one does like a nice
cousin, whom one knows too well to care for in
any other way."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a pity."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it seems to me that you would be
happy with him."</p>

<p>Bijou shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't think so; I must have a husband more
steady than Jean."</p>

<p>"More steady? but he must be thirty-four or
thirty-five&mdash;M. de Blaye."</p>

<p>"What does that matter? he is not steady, you
know&mdash;not by any means."</p>

<p>"Ah! I did not know."</p>

<p>"Then, too, I should want my husband to only
care for me."</p>

<p>"Well, pretty and fascinating as you are, you
can make your mind easy about that."</p>

<p>Bijou stopped suddenly in the middle of the
garden-walk.</p>

<p>"Is not that a carriage coming up the drive?"
she asked, pointing to the avenue.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly it is."</p>

<p>"What sort of a carriage? I cannot see anything,
I am so short-sighted."</p>

<p>"A phaeton with two horses, and a gentleman I
don't know is driving."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, that's it!" And then, as Jeanne
looked at her inquiringly, she added: "It is M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
de Clagny&mdash;a friend of grandmamma's&mdash;the owner
of The Norinière."</p>

<p>"Ah! the man who is so rich!"</p>

<p>"So rich? Do you think he is so rich? I have
not heard a word about that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he is immensely wealthy&mdash;and all his
fortune is in land."</p>

<p>Bijou was not listening to this. She had just
gathered a daisy, which was growing amongst the
grass, bending its little timid head over the garden
pathway, and she was now pulling it to pieces in
an absent-minded way.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Jeanne, smiling; "how does he
love you?"</p>

<p>Bijou lifted her pretty head in surprise.</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The one about whom you were questioning
that daisy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know! I was not questioning it about
anyone in particular."</p>

<p>"And what did it answer you?"</p>

<p>"Passionately."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it was answering about everybody."
And Jeanne added, as she mounted the little flight
of stone steps just behind her friend: "It's quite
true; everybody loves you; and you deserve to be
loved&mdash;there!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>When the two girls entered the room where
everyone was assembled, their arrival seemed to
have the effect of bringing some animation into the
faces of all the people.</p>

<p>"At last, and not before it was time!" murmured
Henry de Bracieux, in a way which caused
his grandmother to glance at him, whilst M. de
Clagny stepped quickly forward to meet Bijou.</p>

<p>"That's right," she said pleasantly; "how good
of you to come again so soon to see us!"</p>

<p>"Too good! You'll have too much of me before
long!"</p>

<p>"Never!" she answered, smiling merrily; and
then taking Jeanne's hand, she introduced her.
"Jeanne Dubuisson&mdash;my best friend&mdash;whom I
shall lose now, because she is going to be
married!"</p>

<p>"But why do you say that, Bijou?" exclaimed
the young girl reproachfully. "You know very
well that, married or not married, I shall always be
your friend."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;everyone says that; but it isn't the same
thing! When one is married one does not belong
to one's parents or friends any more, one belongs
to one's husband&mdash;and to him alone."</p>

<p>"How delightful such delusions are!" murmured
M. de Clagny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Bijou turned towards him abruptly.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was just nonsense!"</p>

<p>"No; I quite understand that you were laughing
at me. Yes, I understand perfectly well; it's no
good shaking your head, I know all the same that
you were making fun of me, because I said that
when one is married one belongs only to one's
husband! Well, that may be very ridiculous, but
it is my idea, and I believe it is M. Spiegel's, too?"</p>

<p>The young man smiled and nodded without
answering.</p>

<p>"Has anyone introduced M. Spiegel?" continued
Bijou, still addressing the count. "No?
well, then, I will repair such negligence. Monsieur
Spiegel, Jeanne's <i>fiancé</i>, who does not dare to support
me, and declare that I am right, because he is
not in the majority here; there is no one here
who is married but himself&mdash;that is to say, nearly
married."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, and what about Paul?" asked the
marchioness, laughing.</p>

<p>"Paul! Oh, yes, that's true; I was not thinking
of him! Anyhow, the unmarried persons are in
the majority&mdash;Henry, Pierrot, Monsieur Courteil,
M. Giraud, Jean&mdash;well, what's the matter with
Jean? he does look queer!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean de Blaye was seated in an arm-chair, with
his eyes half-closed and his head resting on his
hand, looking very drowsy.</p>

<p>"I have a headache!" he answered; and then,
as Bijou persisted, and wanted to know what had
given him a headache, he exclaimed gruffly:
"Well, what do you want me to say? It's a headache;
how can I tell what's given it me? It
comes itself how it likes&mdash;that's all I know!"</p>

<p>Bijou had gone behind the arm-chair in which
her cousin was lounging.</p>

<p>"You must have a very, very bad headache to
look as you do," she said, not at all discouraged by
his abrupt manner, and noticing his pale face,
his drawn features, and his eyes, with dark
circles round them, "and for you to own, too,
that there is anything the matter with you;
because you always set up for being so strong
and well. Poor Jean, I do wish you could get
rid of it."</p>

<p>She bent forward, and pressing her lips gently
on the young man's weary eyelids, remained like
that a few seconds.</p>

<p>Jean de Blaye turned pale, and then very red,
and rose hastily from his chair.</p>

<p>"You startled me," he said, in an embarrassed
way, not knowing where to look, "how stupid I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
am; but I did not see you were so near, so you quite
surprised me."</p>

<p>M. de Clagny had risen, too, in an excited way
on seeing Bijou kiss her cousin. It occurred to
him though, at once, how very ridiculous his
jealousy would appear, and he sat down again, saying
in a jesting tone:</p>

<p>"Well, if that remedy does not take effect,
de Blaye's case is incurable."</p>

<p>M. de Rueille looked enviously at Jean, who was
just going out of the drawing-room, and then, turning
to Bijou, he remarked, in a hoarse voice:</p>

<p>"When I have a headache, and, unfortunately,
that is very often, you are not so compassionate."</p>

<p>M. Giraud remained petrified in the little low
chair in which he had taken his seat. His eyes
were fixed on the ground, and his lips pressed
closely together; he looked as though he had seen
nothing.</p>

<p>As for Pierrot, he exclaimed candidly:</p>

<p>"What a lucky beggar that Jean is!"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, undoubtedly," replied Abbé
Courteil, with conviction; "but, all the same, he
certainly has a very bad headache&mdash;Monsieur de
Blaye. I know what it is to have a headache."</p>

<p>The marchioness bent forward to whisper to
Bertrade, whilst looking all the time at Bijou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't she sweet, that child, and so good-hearted,
and, above all, so natural. Did you see
how innocently she kissed that simpleton of a
Jean, and how it startled him?"</p>

<p>"Oh! as to startling him! he was rather upset
by it, poor fellow, and he wanted to explain away
the fact that he was upset by it; that is about
all."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? with him, one never knows."</p>

<p>"You did not notice that he went off at once,
without even saying good-bye to M. Dubuisson and
M. Spiegel, who are just going away."</p>

<p>The marchioness turned towards the two men in
question, who were just coming across to take
leave.</p>

<p>"As we are keeping your Jeanne," she said, "I
hope you will often come to see her."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that you don't mind staying
at Bracieux?" Bijou asked her friend; "I shall
not be angry with you, you know, for preferring
your <i>fiancé</i> to me."</p>

<p>"Spiegel is obliged to go to Paris for a few
days," said M. Dubuisson; "on his return I shall
come with him to fetch Jeanne back."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On leaving the drawing-room, a few minutes
before, Jean de Blaye had felt thoroughly wretched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Bijou's innocent kiss, given so openly before everyone,
had, as a matter of fact, thoroughly upset him
rousing again the love which he felt for the young
girl, and which he had hoped would remain dormant,
since Madame de Nézel was ready to console
him with her affection.</p>

<p>Only the evening before he had said to the
young widow: "How can I love that child as I
love you?" and when he had uttered these words,
he had, for the time being, felt his old love for
Madame de Nézel returning, and it had seemed to
him that Bijou could never inspire the same passion
as he had felt for this woman. And now, after
hoping that he had conquered his love for the
young girl, her kiss had completely undone him,
and left him helpless to struggle against himself
any longer.</p>

<p>He felt now that from henceforth he ought not
to continue to claim Madame de Nézel's affection,
since he could no longer return it; and as he thought
of all that this affection had been to him in the
past, he suffered intensely. For the last four years
this woman had loved him with a devotion that
had known no bounds, and, whilst Madame de
Bracieux, M. de Jonzac, the Rueilles, and, indeed,
all his family, had imagined that he was living a
very gay life, he had been spending his time peacefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and happily in the society of Madame de
Nézel.</p>

<p>They had understood each other perfectly, and
no one had suspected anything of the sympathy
which had thus drawn them together, so that Jean
had always been criticised for those actions of his
which were known to the world, and he had been
perfectly satisfied that things should be thus.
Now, however, all would be changed. He would
have to give up this peaceful happiness which had
been so much to him.</p>

<p>And why should he, after all? Did he intend
to tell Bijou of his love for her? And even supposing
that she did not reject his love, was he in
a position to marry this fragile and exquisite
girl, who had certainly been created for the most
luxurious surroundings?</p>

<p>He had already thought it all over many times
and had said to himself, over and over again, that
it would be absurdly foolish. Then, too, Bijou
would never love him well enough to accept him
with his extremely moderate income. As he had
promised Madame de Nézel to meet her the
following day at Pont-sur-Loire, he wrote her a
few lines in order to excuse himself.</p>

<p>"She will not believe the pretext I have given
her," he said to himself, as he sealed the letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
"but she will quite understand, and, now, it is all
over between us."</p>

<p>And then all at once a feeling of utter loneliness
came over him, and a vision of the life that would
from henceforth be his rose before him with strange
distinctness. He shuddered in spite of himself,
and then he fell to going over again in his mind all
his sorrows.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Bijou had shown Jeanne
Dubuisson to the room she was to occupy during
her visit to the château.</p>

<p>"It is your imagination, I tell you; nothing but
your imagination," she said to her friend. "He
does like me, certainly, but just in the way one
cares for a cousin, or even a sister."</p>

<p>"No! It was quite enough to look at his face
when he went out of the drawing-room. He was
quite upset, and I am sure he has not got over it
yet."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like me to go and ask him?
But, there, it is seven o'clock. We have only just
time to dress. I will come back for you when the
first dinner-bell rings."</p>

<p>When Bijou came out of her bedroom, simply
but charmingly dressed, as usual, the long landing
was dark and silent. The servants had drawn the
blinds, but had not yet lighted the lamps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean, who was coming out of his room, could
just distinguish, in the darkness, a few yards
away from him, a figure in a light dress. He
hurried up to it, and Bijou asked:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Jean?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered; "and I want a word with
you."</p>

<p>"Something that won't take long? The first
bell has gone."</p>

<p>"Something very short; but I should prefer no
one else hearing."</p>

<p>"Shall we go into your room, then, or into
mine?"</p>

<p>"Into yours, as we are so near it."</p>

<p>Bijou opened the door, and, when Blaye was
inside, she said:</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. Don't move, or I shall knock
against you. I will light&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't worth getting a light," he said,
catching hold of her arm to stop her. "I can say
what I have to without that. Besides, it won't
take long. I want to tell you, Bijou, my dear,
that what you did, you know, just now&mdash;"</p>

<p>She appeared to be trying to remember.</p>

<p>"Just now? Whatever was it I did?"</p>

<p>"Well, in a very nice way&mdash;oh! in a very nice
way, indeed, you know&mdash;you kissed me, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
are too grown-up to do that now when there are
people there."</p>

<p>"And when there isn't anyone there?" she
asked, laughing, "may I then&mdash;tell me?"</p>

<p>Before he had time to reply, she had laid her
hands on his shoulder, and lifted her face towards
his. He bent his head at the same moment, and
her lips touched his. Bijou gave a little half-timid
murmur of affection, which moved him deeply.</p>

<p>He made up his mind now to tell her of his love,
and tried to draw her to him; but the young girl
pushed back the hands which were endeavouring
to hold her, and ran out of the room, and, by the
rustle of her dress along the wall, Jean knew that
she was hurrying away.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following day Mère Rafut arrived. Bijou
had expected to have her for a week, and was very
much disappointed when the old woman told her
that she could only give her five days, as the
theatre opened again on the first of September,
and she would have to be there at her post as
dresser.</p>

<p>Jeanne, therefore, proposed to help with the
work, and Bijou accepted her offer.</p>

<p>"That's a capital idea!" she said; "if we are
both together we shall not be dull! we can talk to
each other without troubling about Mère Rafut."</p>

<p>Accordingly, every day, whilst the marchioness
and Madame de Rueille were doing what Jean de
Blaye called "a visiting tour," the two young girls
installed themselves in Bijou's boudoir, which was
converted into a sewing-room, and were soon busy
with their cutting out and sewing, whilst chattering
together, too intent on their conversation to pay
much attention to the old sewing-woman.</p>

<p>"Are you going to the race-ball?" Bijou asked
her friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Jeanne; "it seems that as I am now
engaged it is not quite the thing; but I am going
all the same, as Franz wants to see me arrayed in
my ball-dress, and he wants to waltz with me, too;
he waltzes very well, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah! and yet he looks so austere? Tell me,
don't you mind in the least marrying a Protestant?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least! without being bigoted, I am a
thorough Catholic, and he is a devoted Protestant,
but not bigoted either. We shall each of us keep
to our own religion, for we have no wish whatever
to change; but neither of us has any idea of trying
to convert the other."</p>

<p>Bijou did not speak, and Jeanne continued:</p>

<p>"I am not at all sorry that I am going to have
a husband who is a Protestant, and I will confess
that, for certain things, I feel more satisfied that
it should be so. It's quite true, what you were
saying yesterday&mdash;Protestants have certain ideas
about the family, and about constancy; in fact,
they have stricter principles about such things
than Catholics."</p>

<p>"Yes; tell me, though, what dress are you going
to wear for the race ball?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet! I haven't one for it!"</p>

<p>"Why, how's that? what about the white one
with the little bunches of flowers all over it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa does not think it is nice enough; the
race ball is to be at the Tourvilles, you know, this
year; and it will all be very grand!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"We do not know them at all; it will be the first
time of our going to Tourville, and if I were to be
dressed anyhow, it would not be very nice for your
grandmamma, who got us invited; and so papa
told me to have a dress made, and he gave me two
pounds."</p>

<p>"What are you going to have made?"</p>

<p>"I don't know at all; advise me, will you?"</p>

<p>For the last minute or two Bijou had seemed to
be turning something over in her mind.</p>

<p>"If you like," she said at last, "we might be
dressed in the same way, you and I; that would
be awfully nice!"</p>

<p>"What is your dress?"</p>

<p>"My dress does not exist yet; it is a thing of the
future! It will be pink, of course&mdash;pink crêpe&mdash;quite
simple&mdash;straight skirts, cut like a ballet-dancer's
skirts, so that there will be no hem to
make them heavy, three skirts, one over the other,
all of the same length, of course&mdash;three, that makes
it cloudy-looking; more than that smothers you
up; and it will fall in large, round <i>godets</i>. Then
there will be a little gathered bodice, very simple;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
little puffed sleeves, with a lot of ribbon bows and
ends hanging, and then ribbon round the waist,
with two long bows and long ends&mdash;ribbon as wide
as your hand, not any wider.'</p>

<p>"It will be pretty."</p>

<p>"And it would suit you wonderfully well."</p>

<p>"But shouldn't you mind my being dressed like
you?" asked Jeanne, rather timidly.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I should love it! Would you
like us to make the dress here? I would try it
on, and like that we should be sure that it was
right."</p>

<p>"How sweet you are! Plenty of other girls in
your place would only trouble about themselves."</p>

<p>"Listen, supposing you wrote for the crêpe to
be sent to-morrow." And then she added laughing,
"M. de Bernès asked me yesterday evening if
I had not any commissions for Pont-sur-Loire. I
might have given him that to do!"</p>

<p>"He would have been slightly embarrassed."</p>

<p>"Why? It is easy enough to buy pink crêpe
with a pattern."</p>

<p>Mère Rafut, who had been busy sewing, without
uttering a word, but just pulling her needle through
the work with a quick regular movement, now
lifted her face, all wrinkled like an old apple, and
remarked drily:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"And even without!"</p>

<p>"Without what?" asked Bijou.</p>

<p>"Without a pattern. Oh, no, it isn't he who'd
be embarrassed! Why, he always helps to choose
Mademoiselle Lisette Renaud's dresses."</p>

<p>"Lisette Renaud, the singer?" asked Jeanne
eagerly, whilst Denyse, very much taken up with
her work, did not appear to have heard.</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle, the actress."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I meant. Ah! and so
M. de Bernès knows her?"</p>

<p>The old sewing-woman smiled.</p>

<p>"I should just think he does. He's known her
more than a year and a half."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Jeanne, evidently interested, "she
is so pretty, Lisette Renaud! I saw her in
<i>Mignon</i> and in the <i>Dragons de Villars</i> too."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Mère Rafut, "she is pretty,
too, and as good as she is pretty! If you only
knew!"</p>

<p>"Good?" repeated Jeanne, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! For sure, she isn't a young lady like
you, mademoiselle! But ever since she has known
M. de Bernès, I can tell you, she won't look at anyone
else. And he's the same, as far as that goes,
and that's saying a good deal, for, nice-looking as
he is, there's plenty of ladies after him, ladies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the best society, too, in officers' families; and they
do say the Prefect's wife admires him! Oh, my,
he doesn't care a snap for them all, though! He's
got no eyes for anyone but Lisette; but you should
see him when he's looking at her&mdash;it's pretty sure
that if he was an officer of high rank he'd marry
her straight off, and he'd be quite right, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jeanne!" interrupted Bijou, "that's the first
bell for luncheon." And when they were out of the
room she said, in a very gentle voice, with just a
shade of reproach: "Why do you let Mère Rafut
tell you things you ought not to listen to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, goodness!" cried Jeanne, blushing and
looking confused, "her story wasn't so very dreadful;
and then, even if it had been, how do you
think I could help her telling it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that's easy enough, the only thing to do
is not to reply or pay any attention; you would see
that she would soon stop."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right," and throwing her arms
round Bijou, Jeanne kissed her.</p>

<p>"You are always right," she said; "and I,
although I look so serious, am much more thoughtless
than you, and much weaker-minded, too; I
never can resist listening if it is anything that
interests me."</p>

<p>"And did that interest you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very much, indeed."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! what could you find interesting
in it all?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't exactly know; I was curious to
hear about it, in the first place, and then I always
notice everything, and this little story explained
exactly something I had observed."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Why, during the last four or five months, ever
since I have begun going out a little."</p>

<p>"What had you observed?"</p>

<p>"I had observed that M. de Bernès never pays
attention to any woman, that he never even looks
at anyone, that he scarcely takes the trouble to be
pleasant, even with the prettiest girls; and the proof
of all this is, that he has not tried to flirt with you
even."</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all," answered Bijou, laughing; "but
just because he has not tried to flirt with me, you
must not conclude that with others."</p>

<p>"No, Mère Rafut must be right, and, after all, I
am not at all surprised about it&mdash;this story, I mean;
you have no idea how charming she is, this Lisette
Renaud. Something in your style; she is much taller
than you, though, and not so fair; but she has the
most wonderful eyes, and a lovely, graceful figure,
almost as graceful as yours; in short, I can quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
understand that, when anyone does care for her,
they would care for her in earnest; then, added to
all that, she has a great deal of talent and a
beautiful voice&mdash;a contralto. I am sure you would
like her."</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't like women who act comedy&mdash;those who
act well, at least; it denotes a kind of duplicity."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think so; it denotes a faculty of
assimilation, a very sensitive nature, but not
duplicity."</p>

<p>"I can't help it, my dear, but I do not see things
in the same light as you; still, that does not prevent
Mademoiselle&mdash;what is her name?"</p>

<p>"Lisette Renaud."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Lisette Renaud from being an
exception, and she may be a very charming creature;
for my part, I only hope that is so for the
sake of M. de Bernès."</p>

<p>"You don't care much for him, do you?" asked
Jeanne.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?&mdash;he is quite indifferent
to me, and I always look upon him as
being just like everyone else."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; that is not true&mdash;I see him pretty often
at Pont-sur-Loire; he is very intelligent, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
nice, and then, too, very good-looking; don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>"I assure you that I have never paid much
attention to M. de Bernès and his appearance," and
then Bijou added, laughing: "The very first
time I see him, I will look at him with all my
eyes, and I will endeavour to discover his perfections
to please M. de Clagny."</p>

<p>"You like him very much, don't you&mdash;M. de
Clagny?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed I do."</p>

<p>"I noticed that at once; ever since my arrival
you have only talked of him; and yesterday, when
he came, you were delighted."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is so good, and so kind to me."</p>

<p>"But everyone is kind to you, everyone adores
you."</p>

<p>"Everyone is much too good and too indulgent,
as far as I am concerned; I know that very well;
but M. de Clagny is better still than the others.
I have only known him three days, and now I
could not do without him. Whenever I see him,
I feel gay and happy at once; and I wish he were
always here. I'll tell you what&mdash;I should like to
have a father or an uncle like him. Doesn't he
make the same kind of impression on you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as for me, you know, it would be impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to imagine myself with any other father than
papa. Just as he is I adore him; perhaps to other
people he may seem nothing out of the common
but you see he is my father; all the same I like
M. de Clagny, and he is very nice&mdash;he must have
been charming."</p>

<p>"I think he still is charming."</p>

<p>The two girls had reached the hall by this time,
and Jeanne went to the door.</p>

<p>"How very warm it is," she said, and then,
shading her eyes with her hand, she looked out
into the avenue. "Why, there's a mail-coach!"
she exclaimed. "Whoever would be coming with
a mail-coach?"</p>

<p>"M. de Clagny, of course," cried Bijou, rushing
out on to the steps in her delight; "he
told grandmamma that if he possibly could he
should come and ask her to give him some
luncheon."</p>

<p>"And he has managed to," remarked M. de
Rueille drily, as he, too, approached the hall
door; "we've seen a great deal of him these
last three days; certainly, he is very devoted
to us," he added sarcastically.</p>

<p>The sight of the horses, which were just being
pulled up in front of the steps, somewhat appeased
him, however.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"By Jove! what horses!" he exclaimed, in admiration,
"and he knows how to drive, too; there's
no mistake about that, he's a born aristocrat."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After luncheon, Pierrot declared that his foot
hurt him just at the end of each toe, and he did
not know what it could be.</p>

<p>"I know, though," remarked Jean de Blaye; "his
boots are too short."</p>

<p>"Too short!" exclaimed M. de Jonzac, "oh, no,
that's impossible"&mdash;and then, after a moment's
reflection, he added in terror: "unless his feet have
got bigger still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which they probably have," said Jean, laughing;
"anyhow, his toes are turned up at the ends
and curl back over each other, I am sure; you
have only to look at his feet, now, to tell. Look at
the lumps in his boots; they look like bags of nuts."</p>

<p>"I must get him some more boots to-day," said
M. de Jonzac.</p>

<p>"The best thing, uncle, would be to send him to
Pont-sur-Loire to be measured; there's sure to be a
decent bootmaker there."</p>

<p>"M. Courteil is going just now to take a letter
to the bishop and get an answer to it," remarked
Madame de Bracieux; "he might take Pierrot
with him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," said Bijou, "they might take our
omnibus, so that Jeanne and I could go too; we
have some errands to do."</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked the marchioness.</p>

<p>"Well, first, some crêpe&mdash;we want some crêpe for
Jeanne; and then some pencils and paints that I
am short of; in fact, there are a lot of things."</p>

<p>"Would you like me to take you all?" proposed
M. de Clagny; "I have some business with a
lawyer at Pont-sur-Loire at three o'clock. You
could do all your errands, and then I would bring
you back; it's on my way to The Norinière."</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun!" exclaimed Bijou, delighted.
"I have never been on a mail-coach; you don't
mind, grandmamma?"</p>

<p>Madame de Bracieux seemed rather undecided.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, Bijou dear; you see at
Pont-sur-Loire you will be noticed very much
perched up there, and for two young girls I don't
know whether it is quite the thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmamma," protested Bijou, "not the
thing! and with M. de Clagny there!"</p>

<p>"Yes, with me," put in the count, with emphasis,
his face suddenly clouding over, "there is no
danger; I am safe enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," replied Madame de Bracieux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
with evident sincerity; "but at Pont-sur-Loire
everyone is so fond of gossip and scandal."</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmamma," Bijou said, in a beseeching
tone, "don't deprive us of a treat, which you don't
see any harm in whatever yourself, just because of
the Pont-sur-Loire people, about whom you do
not care at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right. Go, then, children, as you
want to, for, as you say, there is no harm whatever
in amusing yourselves in that way."</p>

<p>"Is there any room for me?" asked M. de
Rueille.</p>

<p>"For you, and some more of you," answered M.
de Clagny; "we are only six at present."</p>

<p>The marchioness turned towards Bertrade.</p>

<p>"What do you say about going with them to
look after the girls?"</p>

<p>Madame de Rueille glanced at her husband, who
appeared to be studying the floor attentively at
that moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, Paul will look after them very well!"</p>

<p>"I must ask if you would mind not starting before
three o'clock?" said Bijou, advancing towards
the window, "because there is M. Sylvestre coming
to give me my accompaniment lesson; he is just
coming up the avenue."</p>

<p>"The poor fellow!" exclaimed the marchioness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
glancing out of the window, "he is actually walking
in spite of this terrible heat!"</p>

<p>"He always walks, grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Five miles; that is not so tremendous," remarked
Henry de Bracieux.</p>

<p>"No, not for you&mdash;driving!" said Bijou.</p>

<p>"Well, but when we are out shooting, we do a
lot more than that!"</p>

<p>"But you are enjoying yourself when you are
out shooting; that's quite different. I know very
well that if I could, I should send M. Sylvestre
back always in the carriage."</p>

<p>"If you like, we can drive him back to-day,"
said M. de Clagny.</p>

<p>"I should just think I should like to! You are
very good to offer me that, because, you know, he
is not very, very handsome&mdash;my professor&mdash;and he
will not be any ornament on your coach!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I care anything about that? I
am not snobbish, Bijou; not the least bit snobbish."</p>

<p>"But he isn't bad-looking, this fellow," said Jean
de Blaye. "He has very fine eyes; they are
wonderfully limpid and soft."</p>

<p>"I never noticed that," answered Bijou, laughing;
"but even if they are, they could not be seen very
well on the top of a coach. And he is very
queerly dressed; he wears clothes that are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
small, and which cling to him; and then long hair
that is very lank; he looks rather like a drowned
rat."</p>

<p>A domestic appeared at this instant to announce
that M. Sylvestre had arrived.</p>

<p>"Have you told Josephine?" asked Madame
Bracieux.</p>

<p>"Yes, Josephine is there, madame," replied the
servant.</p>

<p>Jeanne Dubuisson rose, but Bijou stopped her.</p>

<p>"No, don't come with me," she said; "when I
feel that there is anyone listening, that is, anyone
beside Josephine, I don't do any good." And
then, just as she was going out of the room, she
turned round, and added: "At three o'clock I shall
appear with my hat&mdash;and M. Sylvestre."</p>

<p>When Bijou entered her room, Josephine, the old
housekeeper, who had seen two generations of the
Bracieux family grow up, was sewing near the
window, whilst, in the little room adjoining, the
musician was arranging the music-stand, and
taking his violin out of the case.</p>

<p>On seeing the young girl, his blue eyes lighted
up, and seemed to turn pale against his red face.
He was a young man of about twenty-eight years
of age, very thin, very awkward, and dressed
wretchedly enough; but there was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
interesting about his face, an expression that was
congenial, and yet, at the same time, told of
anxiety and of trouble.</p>

<p>"How warm you are, Monsieur Sylvestre!" said
Bijou, as she held out her hand to him; "and they
have not brought you anything to drink yet!
Josephine!" she called out, as she moved towards
the door between the two rooms, "will you tell
them to bring&mdash;ah, yes, what are they to bring?
What will you take, Monsieur Sylvestre?&mdash;beer,
lemonade, wine, or what? I never remember!"</p>

<p>"Some lemonade, if you please; but you really
are too good, mademoiselle, to trouble about
me."</p>

<p>"I forgot to buy the music you told me to get
when I was at Pont-sur-Loire," said Denyse, interrupting
him. "You will scold me."</p>

<p>"Oh! mademoiselle!" he exclaimed, in a scared
way, "<i>I</i> scold you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you! If you do not scold me you ought
to. Now, let me see! What are we going to
play? Ah! I was forgetting! I am going to
ask you if you will begin by accompanying me at
the piano; it is just a silly little song I am
learning."</p>

<p>"What song is it?"</p>

<p>"'Ay Chiquita'! it is quite grotesque, isn't it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
But we have an old friend who adores it, and he
asked me to sing it for him."</p>

<p>"Oh! as to that!&mdash;'Ay Chiquita'&mdash;it isn't so
grotesque; but it has been worn out, that's all.
Ah!" he added, looking at the music, "you sing
it in a higher key. I was wondering, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I sing it higher; that makes it more
dreadful still. Oh, dear! how I do wish I had a
deep voice; they are so lovely&mdash;deep voices, but
there are none to be heard!"</p>

<p>"They are rare, certainly; but there are some,
nevertheless."</p>

<p>"I have never heard one," said Bijou, shaking
her head.</p>

<p>"Well, but you might hear one if you liked."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Why, at the Pont-sur-Loire theatre. Yes,
Mademoiselle Lisette Renaud, a young actress,
with a great deal of talent, and she is very pretty,
too, which is not a drawback, by any means."</p>

<p>"She has a beautiful voice?"</p>

<p>"Very beautiful! I hear her, on an average,
three times a week, without reckoning the rehearsals
with the orchestra, and, I can assure you,
I have never had enough."</p>

<p>"Ah! Do you think she would sing at private
houses?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, certainly! She does sing sometimes at
Pont-sur-Loire."</p>

<p>"I will ask grandmamma to have her here.
Where does she live?"</p>

<p>"Rue Rabelais. I do not remember the number,
but she is very well known."</p>

<p>After a short silence, the professor asked:</p>

<p>"Why should you not go to the theatre to hear
her? That would interest you much more."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma would never let me."</p>

<p>"I know, of course, that society people do not
go to the Pont-sur-Loire theatre&mdash;it is not considered
the thing; but there are circumstances,&mdash;for
instance&mdash;in a fortnight from now there
is to be a performance for the benefit of disabled
soldiers, organised by the <i>Dames de France</i>;
everyone will go to that."</p>

<p>"And they will play things that will be all
right?"</p>

<p>"Oh! some comic opera or another, and
varieties from other things; but I am sure Lisette
Renaud will be on the programme, and several
times, too. These are the best sort of things that
we have at the theatre."</p>

<p>"You are not drinking anything, Monsieur
Sylvestre," said Bijou, approaching the tray which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
had been brought in, and pouring out the lemonade
for the young man.</p>

<p>The glass which she passed to him showed the
effect of the contact of her hand.</p>

<p>"Are you not still too warm to drink?" she
asked. "This lemonade is very cold."</p>

<p>He took the glass with a hand that trembled
slightly, and stood there, with his arm stretched
out, looking at Bijou with passionate admiration.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Sylvestre," she said, smiling, "a
penny for your thoughts."</p>

<p>The young man's face, which was already red,
flushed deeper still. He drank his lemonade at a
draught, and hurried to the piano.</p>

<p>"Let us begin, mademoiselle! shall we?" he
said, and he played the short symphony of the
song in a hesitating way, as though his fingers
refused to act. This was so noticeable, that
Denyse asked him:</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you? you are not in
form to-day, at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing, mademoiselle; I&mdash;it is so
warm."</p>

<p>Being rather short-sighted, and never using a
lorgnette, Bijou was obliged to bend forward to
read the words of the song, and sometimes, in doing
so, she touched the professor's hair or shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
This served to increase his agitation, and at times
he could scarcely see what he was playing, whilst
his fingers would slip off the notes.</p>

<p>"Really, you are not at all in form to-day," repeated
Bijou, surprised.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, mademoiselle, I&mdash;I don't
know what is the matter with me."</p>

<p>"Nor I either; I can't tell at all," she said,
laughing.</p>

<p>He was getting up from the piano, but she
begged him to sit down again.</p>

<p>"No! if you don't mind," she said, "I should
like to work up two or three old songs."</p>

<p>She began at once to read at sight, bending over
in order to see better, whilst the poor young man,
who was now pale, did his best to follow her, in
spite of the buzzing in his ears and the clamminess
of his fingers.</p>

<p>When the lesson was over, Bijou went to fetch
her hat, and then came back and put it on at the
glass near the piano.</p>

<p>Instead of putting his violin into its case, M.
Sylvestre stood watching her as she lifted her arms,
and drew her pretty figure up with a graceful swaying
movement.</p>

<p>"Be quick!" she said, "we are going to take
you back to Pont-sur-Loire, or rather M. de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Clagny, one of our friends, is going to take you
on his coach." Denyse saw that he did not
understand, so she went on to explain: "It's a
large carriage, and holds a good number of
people."</p>

<p>"Are you going, too?" he asked excitedly.</p>

<p>"I am going, too&mdash;yes, Monsieur Sylvestre."</p>

<p>He was just taking from his violin-case a little
bunch of forget-me-nots and wild roses, which were
already drooping their poor little heads. He held
them out timidly to Bijou.</p>

<p>"As I came along, mademoiselle, I&mdash;I took the
liberty of gathering these flowers for you."</p>

<p>She took them, and after inhaling their perfume
for a minute or two, put them into her
waistband.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for having thought of me,"
she said.</p>

<p>He followed Bijou downstairs, step by step,
happy in the present, forgetting all about his
poverty, and as he appeared, tripping along behind
the young girl, his violin-case in his hand, M. de
Clagny turned to Jean de Blaye, and remarked:</p>

<p>"You were right; he has a nice face."</p>

<p>The mail-coach had just appeared in front of the
steps when the marchioness called out:</p>

<p>"Bijou! I have a commission for you. Go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Pellerin the bookseller, and ask him&mdash;stop&mdash;no&mdash;send
Pierrot here."</p>

<p>"Pierrot," said Denyse, returning to the hall,
"grandmamma wants you."</p>

<p>"I'll bet it's some errand to do," remarked the
youth, making a grimace, "and errands are not
much in my line." And then, whilst Bijou and
the others were clambering up on to the coach,
he went back to Madame de Bracieux. "You
wanted me, aunt?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Will you go to Pellerin's? do you know
which is Pellerin's?"</p>

<p>"The book shop."</p>

<p>"Yes. Ask him for a novel of Dumas' for me.
It is called 'Le Bâtard de Mauléon.' What are
you looking at me for in that bewildered way?"</p>

<p>"Because I have never seen you reading novels,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will not see me reading this one either;
it is for the curé, I have promised it him. He
adores Dumas, and he does not know 'Le Bâtard de
Mauléon.' You will remember the title?"</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt."</p>

<p>"You are sure? You would not like me to
write it for you?"</p>

<p>"'Tisn't worth while."</p>

<p>"You will forget it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"No danger."</p>

<p>He rushed off, looking down on the ground, and
then, as he climbed on to the coach, he trod on
the feet of various people, nearly smashed M.
Sylvestre's violin-case, and excused himself by
saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, by Jove! I've nearly done for the little
coffin."</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Always</span> up first in the morning, Bijou was in the
habit of going downstairs towards seven o'clock, in
order to attend to her housekeeping duties.</p>

<p>She always paid a visit to the pantry, and to the
dairy, and, with the exception of Pierrot, who was
sometimes wandering about the passages with very
sleepy-looking eyes, she never met anybody at
this early hour.</p>

<p>To her astonishment, therefore, on this particular
morning she nearly ran up against M. de
Rueille, who was coming out of the library with a
book in his hand.</p>

<p>Of all the visitors at Bracieux he was the laziest,
so that Bijou laughed as she commented on his
early rising.</p>

<p>"How's this?" she asked; "have you finished
your slumbers already?"</p>

<p>"Or, rather, I have not commenced them!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!"</p>

<p>"No, and as I had finished all the literature I
had upstairs, I came down to get a book to finish
my night with."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Bijou pointed to the sun, which was streaming in
by the open window.</p>

<p>"Your night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, as far as I am concerned, you know, unless
I am going out shooting, or off by train
somewhere, it is night up to ten o'clock, at
least!"</p>

<p>"And you are now going to bed again?"</p>

<p>"This very instant."</p>

<p>"But it is ridiculous."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it is very wise, and all the
more so, as, when one is in a bad temper, the best
thing to do is to keep one's self out of the
way."</p>

<p>"You are in a bad temper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>Paul de Rueille hesitated slightly before answering.</p>

<p>"I don't know why."</p>

<p>"It's quite true," said Bijou, laughing, "that you
were not very amiable yesterday during our
journey to Pont-sur-Loire."</p>

<p>"It was your fault!"</p>

<p>"My fault&mdash;mine?"</p>

<p>"Yours."</p>

<p>"And pray why?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tell you if you like."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should like; but not now, because I am
keeping some one waiting in the dairy."</p>

<p>"Who is waiting for you?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"The dairy-maid," answered Bijou, without
noticing his anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh! go at once, then, if that is the case," said
M. de Rueille sarcastically. "I should not like
the dairy-maid to be kept waiting on my
account."</p>

<p>"You should come and see the cheeses," proposed
Denyse.</p>

<p>"That must certainly be very festive; no, really,
are you not afraid that I should find that too
exciting, Bijou, my dear?"</p>

<p>"You would find it as exciting, anyhow, as
going to bed, and reading over again some old
book that you must know by heart. Oh, you know
it by heart, I am sure! There is nothing in the
library but the classics, or a lot of old-fashioned
things; ever since I have come no new books are
put in the library, either in the Paris house or
here at Bracieux. Grandmamma is so afraid
that I should get hold of them; but she is
quite mistaken, for I should never open a book
that I had been told not to open&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Grandmamma is afraid of your doing what any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
other girl would do; you are such an astonishing
exception, Bijou!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am an exception&mdash;an angel, anything
you like; but either come with me, or let me go, if
you please! I don't like to keep people waiting."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'll come with you if you like," said
M. de Rueille, putting his book down on a side-table.</p>

<p>He followed Bijou without speaking, as she
trotted along in front of him. She looked so
sweet, going backwards and forwards amongst the
great pails of milk; her straw hat, covered with lace,
tossed carelessly on her fair hair; her morning dress,
of pink batiste, fastened up rather high with a
safety-pin.</p>

<p>She inspected everything, gave her orders, and
settled all kinds of details, without troubling about
her cousin any more than if he did not exist; and
then, when she had quite finished, she turned
towards him, smiling.</p>

<p>"Now, then," she said, "if you would like a
stroll, I am at your service." She turned into one
of the garden paths that led to the avenues, and
then added, as she looked up at Paul, "I'm listening!"</p>

<p>"You are listening? What do you want me to
say?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you were going to tell me why you
were so bad-tempered yesterday; you said it was
my fault."</p>

<p>"Well, it was; you were&mdash;" he began, in an embarrassed
way; and then he continued, in desperation,
"the way you went on, it was not at all like
you generally are, nor like you ought to be!"</p>

<p>"Ah! what did I do then?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, you insisted, in the
most extraordinary way, that Bernès should come
on to the coach when we met him. Why did you
insist like that?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is natural enough when you meet
anyone walking a mile away from where you are
driving yourself, that you should offer to pick him
up; it seems to me that it would be odd, on the
contrary, not to offer to pick him up!"</p>

<p>"Yes, agreed; but then it was M. de Clagny
who should have offered a seat in his own carriage."</p>

<p>"He never thought of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or else he did not care to? And you obliged
him to do it whether he would or not?"</p>

<p>"Rubbish! he adores M. de Bernès. The other
day he spent half an hour singing his praises to me
in every key."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is probably what made you so
pleasant to him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was I so pleasant?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! As a rule you don't pay the
slightest attention to him, but yesterday you had
no eyes for anyone but him."</p>

<p>"I did not notice that myself."</p>

<p>"Really? Well, you were the only one who did
not, then! You went on to such a degree that I
wondered if it were not simply for the sake of
tormenting me that you were acting in that way!"</p>

<p>Bijou gazed straight at M. de Rueille with her
beautiful, luminous eyes.</p>

<p>"To torment you? and how could it torment
you if I chose to be agreeable to M. de Bernès?"</p>

<p>"How?" stuttered M. de Rueille, very much
confused; "why, I have just told you I am not&mdash;we
are not accustomed to seeing you make a fuss
like that, especially of a young man! No, I assure
you, I was amazed. I am still, in fact."</p>

<p>"And I am ever so sorry to have vexed you,"
she said sweetly. "Yes, I am really; you see, I
had never noticed M. de Bernès particularly, and I
wanted to see whether all the nice things M. de
Clagny had told me about him were quite true,
and so I was studying him. Will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>M. de Rueille did not reply to this, as he had
another grievance on his mind.</p>

<p>"With Clagny, too, you have a way of carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
on, which is not at all the thing. He is an old man;
that's all well and good; but, you know, he is not so
ancient yet for you to be able to take such liberties
with him!"</p>

<p>"What do you call liberties?"</p>

<p>"Well, sometimes you appear to admire him, to
be in ecstasies about him; and then sometimes you
coax and wheedle him in the most absurd way, as
you did yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yesterday! I coaxed and wheedled M. de
Clagny? I?"</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"But about what?"</p>

<p>"When you would insist, in spite of everything,
in driving through Rue Rabelais; and I'll be hanged
if I can see why you wanted to; it's about as
dirty a street as there is, without taking into
account that you might have caused us all to
break our necks. Yes, certainly, it was the
most dangerous experiment&mdash;your fad! Young
Bernès, who is one of the most out-and-out daring
fellows himself, tried to persuade you out of wanting
to go along that street!"</p>

<p>The strange little gleam, which sometimes
lighted up Bijou's eyes, came into them now.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true!" she said, smiling. "He was
wild to prevent our going down the Rue Rabelais&mdash;M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
de Bernès! It was as though he was afraid of
something!"</p>

<p>"He was afraid of coming to smash, by Jove,
just as I was, and the abbé, and even Pierrot. I
cannot understand how old Clagny could have let
you have your fad out, for he was responsible for
the little Dubuisson girl, and for Pierrot, and you,
without reckoning all of us!"</p>

<p>"Have you finished blowing me up?"</p>

<p>"I am not blowing you up."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's cool. Let's make it up now,
shall we?" and, standing on tip-toes, Bijou held
her pretty face up, saying, "Kiss me?"</p>

<p>He stepped back abruptly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Bijou, in surprise, and looking
hurt, "you won't kiss me?"</p>

<p>Paul de Rueille had been so taken aback, that he
could scarcely find any words.</p>

<p>"It isn't that I won't, but&mdash;well, not here like
that, it is so absurd! I cannot understand your not
seeing how ridiculous it is."</p>

<p>Bijou shook her rough head, and the loose curls
over her forehead danced about.</p>

<p>"No, I do not see that it is at all ridiculous," and
then, instead of going any farther, she turned round,
and they went back to the house without another
word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>On going up into his room, M. de Rueille found
his wife reading a letter.</p>

<p>"I have just heard from Dr. Brice," she said,
handing him the letter. "It seemed to me that
Marcel had not been well just lately."</p>

<p>"Not well&mdash;Marcel? Why the child eats and
drinks more than I do. He sleeps like a top,
too, and grows like a mushroom. Oh, that's good,
that is! And what disease has he discovered in
the boy&mdash;our excellent Brice?"</p>

<p>"No disease at all!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's lucky!</p>

<p>"But he orders him to have sea-air."</p>

<p>"Sea-air for a lad who is in such downright
good health that it positively makes him unbearable,
he is so riotous?"</p>

<p>"Read what he says."</p>

<p>"Let me see what he says," murmured M. de
Rueille, putting on a look of resignation, as he
began to read the long letter, in which the doctor
advised sea-air as the best remedy for the child in
his present nervous state.</p>

<p>"And so he is in a nervous state?" said M.
de Rueille jeeringly; "and on account of this,
which no one, by the bye, except you, has noticed,
we are to leave Bracieux, where the lad is flourishing
in this delightful fresh air&mdash;it is his native air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in fact&mdash;and we are to go and take up our abode at
some stupid seaside place? Oh, no! You really
do get hold of some ridiculous ideas sometimes."</p>

<p>He was still irritated after his discussion with
Bijou, and the idea of going away from her now
caused him to speak in a harsh, dry way. He
tried to laugh, too, but his laugh sounded forced
and hollow.</p>

<p>Bertrade looked at him as she said gently:</p>

<p>"I did not want to tell you the truth straight
out; I hoped that you would guess it. Do you
not guess?"</p>

<p>"No, not at all," he answered, with a vague feeling
of uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you were right just now; not only
Marcel, and his brothers too, for that matter, are
better at Bracieux than anywhere else, but he has
nothing the matter with him."</p>

<p>As M. de Rueille looked surprised, she continued,
in a tranquil way:</p>

<p>"It is Marcel's father who is not quite himself,
who needs a change of air, and who will, I am
sure, decide on having a change."</p>

<p>"Well, really," he stammered out, "I do not
know what you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean that you must leave Bracieux for a
time," she answered, speaking very distinctly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you particularly wish me to tell you
why?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"You are unwise to insist. You know that in
a general way I never interfere in anything that
you choose to do, or leave undone."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have always been very sweet and very
sensible about everything," said M. de Rueille,
"and I thoroughly appreciate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no need to say anything about all
that. I have always left you quite free to act in
every way as you preferred, and now, in this
matter, I do not bear you any ill-feeling whatever,
and I should never have spoken to you of it if I
had not seen that you are going too far. I have
confidence in you, so that I know you will be on
your guard; but I know how fascinating Bijou is,
and I can see perfectly well that, next to poor
young Giraud, you are the one who is the most
infatuated."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are quite right, I am infatuated; but,
as you say yourself, there is no danger whatever,
and whether I go away, or whether I stay here, it
is all the same; that will make no difference
whatever."</p>

<p>"Yes! if you stay you will certainly make
yourself ridiculous, and probably wretched, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
I am speaking to you now just as a friend might.
Let us go away; believe me, it would be
better."</p>

<p>"Well, but when we came back again&mdash;for we
should come back, shouldn't we? in two months at
the latest&mdash;things would, be exactly as they were
before."</p>

<p>"No, it would be quite different," she answered
carelessly. "In two months' time she will be
married, or nearly so."</p>

<p>"Married!" exclaimed M. de Rueille, astounded.
"Married! Jean is going to marry her, then?"</p>

<p>"Why, no! Jean is not going to marry her.
He's another one who would do well to make himself
scarce."</p>

<p>"Well, if it is not Jean, I do not see&mdash;it is not
Henry, I presume?"</p>

<p>"No, not Henry either. He understands perfectly
well that, with what he has, he cannot marry
Bijou."</p>

<p>"Well, who is it, then? Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, no one at all&mdash;that is, no one in
particular."</p>

<p>"You spoke, on the contrary, as though you
were affirming something that was quite settled.
You said: <i>In two months' time she will be married,
or nearly so</i>. What did you mean by that? Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
don't you want to tell me? You have been told
not to? It is a secret?"</p>

<p>"No, it is merely a supposition, I assure you,
that is all."</p>

<p>"And this supposition you will not tell me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>After a short silence Madame de Rueille began
again:</p>

<p>"I showed grandmamma the doctor's letter;
she is very sorry about our going away. She
adores the children, and then, too, she likes to
have the house full at Bracieux."</p>

<p>"And she let herself be gulled with this story
about Marcel's nervous condition? I am surprised
at that; she is so sharp!"</p>

<p>"If she was not <i>gulled</i>, as you call it, she allowed
me to think that she was. I shall see you again
presently: I must get ready for breakfast."</p>

<p>M. de Rueille went up to his wife, and asked, in
a half-timid way:</p>

<p>"You are angry with me about it?"</p>

<p>"I? why should I be angry about what you
cannot help? You are in the same situation as
Jean, M. Giraud, Henry, the accompaniment professor,
Pierrot, and others that we don't know of,
not to speak of the abbé, who, at present, is always
to be found somewhere round about where Bijou is."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"It's perfectly true; the only thing is that, as
far as he is concerned, he is unconscious of it. Without
understanding the why and wherefore, he, too,
is captivated by Bijou's charms just the same as
all the others who come near her. I am quite sure
that he, too, will be unhappy about going away
from here; but he will not be able to explain to
himself even the cause of his unhappiness. Ah!
there's the bell; I shall never be ready; you had
better go on down."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Pierrot," said the marchioness, after breakfast,
when everyone had assembled in the morning-room,
"you did not give me my book yesterday?"</p>

<p>Pierrot, who was talking to Bijou, turned round,
somewhat taken aback.</p>

<p>"What book, aunt?"</p>

<p>"Dumas' novel for the curé."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; I could not think what book you
meant!"</p>

<p>"You forgot to do my errand?"</p>

<p>"Not at all! but Pellerin hadn't it."</p>

<p>"Oh, why&mdash;he always has everything one
wants!"</p>

<p>"Well, he hadn't got that; and, what was better
still, he didn't seem to know the book at all!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"No, it's quite true! and he's an obstinate sort
of beggar, too, he would have it that it wasn't by
the father&mdash;what's his name? ah! I've forgotten
already."</p>

<p>"Dumas!"</p>

<p>"Dumas! yes, that's it; and he kept on saying
all the time, 'I know my Dumas well enough, and
that book was never written by him.' Well, anyhow,
he promised to try to get it, and to send it to
you if it is to be had."</p>

<p>M. de Rueille was sorting out the letters, which
had arrived during breakfast-time.</p>

<p>"Here's a letter from your bookseller, grandmamma,"
he said; "he evidently has not been able
to get it."</p>

<p>"Open it, Paul, will you?"</p>

<p>Rueille tore open the envelope, and, taking out
the letter, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;It is quite impossible to get the
book which your nephew asked for. As we were
anxious to execute your order, we sent to several
of the principal booksellers, and even wired to
Paris, but we were informed that there is not, and
there never has been, a book entitled, 'Le Bâton de
M. Molard.'"</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Le Bâton de M. Molard?" repeated the
marchioness, not understanding in the least.
"What is he talking about?" and then, all at
once, the explanation of the mystery dawned
upon her, and she exclaimed, in consternation:
"Ah, I see! 'Le Bâton de M. Molard' is 'Le Bâtard
de Mauléon,' translated by Pierrot into his own
language. I was quite right in wanting to write
the title for him, but he would not hear of it."</p>

<p>M. de Jonzac turned his eyes up towards the
ceiling with a tragic gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"He is incorrigible&mdash;absolutely hopeless," he
said, half laughing and half vexed.</p>

<p>"I can't help it, I am as I was made," said
Pierrot, blushing furiously and very much annoyed.
"And then, too, I didn't know what I was doing
yesterday; we were almost upset going into Pont-sur-Loire."</p>

<p>"Almost upset?" exclaimed Madame de Bracieux,
"upset! why, how?"</p>

<p>"Because Bijou had the insane idea of wanting
to go down the Rue Rabelais with the coach; and
so M. de Clagny went&mdash;the old fool."</p>

<p>"Stop! that's enough!" interrupted the marchioness;
"will you kindly speak more respectfully
when you have anything to say about my old friend
Clagny?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, all the same, your old friend hasn't
got his head screwed on very well, considering
his age. He might have killed us; and, besides
that, I can tell you we did kick up a shindy in the
Rue Rabelais. The coach scraped against the
curb-stones; all the kids were running along nearly
under the horses' heels; then the sound of the horn
brought all the women to the windows, and didn't
they exclaim when they saw what it was. That
part wasn't so bad, either, for there were some
jolly pretty ones, I can tell you; weren't there,
Paul?"</p>

<p>As M. de Rueille appeared to be preoccupied,
and did not answer, Pierrot turned to the abbé.</p>

<p>"Weren't there, M. Courteil?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered the abbé, with evident
sincerity; "I was not noticing."</p>

<p>Pierrot did not intend to give in.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, Bijou noticed them anyhow, for
I can tell you she <i>did</i> look at them, and with
eyes as sharp as needles, too; they shone like
anything."</p>

<p>"I?" she exclaimed, her pretty face turning
suddenly red. "It was your fancy, Pierrot; I
never saw anything. I was much too frightened."</p>

<p>"Frightened of what?" asked the marchioness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, of being upset, grandmamma. Pierrot is
right about that; we were nearly upset."</p>

<p>"He is right, too, in saying that it was an insane
idea to want to go with a carriage and four horses
down a wretched little street like that; however
could you have had such an idea?"</p>

<p>Bijou glanced at Jeanne Dubuisson, who, with her
eyes fixed on the carpet, had turned very red, too,
and was listening to the discussion without taking
any part in it.</p>

<p>"Oh, really, I don't know. I think it was M. de
Clagny telling me that his horses were so well in
hand that he could make them turn round on a
plate. And so, as the Rue Rabelais is rather
narrow and winding, I said: 'I am sure you
could not go along Rue Rabelais.'"</p>

<p>"No!" protested Pierrot, "it was not quite like
that. You said, 'Let us go down Rue Rabelais, I
should like to see it.' And, then, as he hesitated&mdash;for
we may as well give him credit for having
hesitated&mdash;you stuck to it as hard as you could."</p>

<p>"But," put in M. de Jonzac, seeing that Denyse
looked annoyed, "what interest could your cousin
possibly have in wanting to go down that street?"</p>

<p>"That's what I wondered," said Pierrot, looking
puzzled; and then, suddenly taken with another
idea, he added: "I can tell you there was somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
who didn't like it, and that was M. de Bernès.
I don't know what took him, but he did pull a
long face. Oh, my! I can tell you he did look
blue."</p>

<p>Henry de Bracieux laughed.</p>

<p>"I know why he was pulling such a long face,
poor old Bernès; he was afraid of being blown
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blown up?" asked Bijou, innocently opening
her limpid eyes wide in surprise, whilst Jeanne's
face, usually so impassive, turned almost purple.
"Blown up? by whom?"</p>

<p>And then, as there was a dead silence, which
became more and more embarrassing, Bijou turned
to her friend.</p>

<p>"Let's go out for a stroll in the garden, Jeanne,
shall we?" she said.</p>

<p>"I'll come with you," remarked Pierrot promptly;
but Bijou pushed him gently back.</p>

<p>"No! we shall do very well by ourselves, thank
you; you would worry us."</p>

<p>As the two girls were descending the hall-door
steps, Bijou said to Jeanne, who was just behind
her, and who had not quite recovered from her
embarrassment:</p>

<p>"I know why you looked so conscious just now;
you were thinking of the gossip about that actress&mdash;I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
forgotten her name&mdash;whom M. de Bernès
knows. I had not thought of it at the time, and
so it did not trouble me. You see I was right
when I told you that it was a mistake to listen to
Mère Rafut's tales."</p>

<p>"Yes, you always are right!" answered Jeanne
pensively; "I said then that you are always right!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After Bijou's departure, the men one after another
left the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bertrade?" asked the
marchioness, as soon as she found herself alone
with Madame de Rueille. "Paul looked very
queer during breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Did you think so?" said the young wife, not
wishing either to acknowledge it or to tell an
untruth about the matter.</p>

<p>"I did think so, and you looked queer too; and
as I watched you both, an idea dawned upon me."</p>

<p>"And what is this idea?"</p>

<p>"It is that my dear little Marcel is no more ill
than I am, and that the letter you showed me this
morning is nothing but a pretext for getting your
husband away from here; is that so?"</p>

<p>Madame de Rueille was too straightforward to
be able to deny the fact.</p>

<p>"It is so!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so you are jealous, and jealous of Bijou?"</p>

<p>"Not jealous, oh, dear no! not in the least; but
anxious."</p>

<p>"About Bijou?"</p>

<p>Madame de Rueille looked serious as she shook
her pretty head.</p>

<p>"No, about Paul."</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of your husband going too
far, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"I am anxious about his peace of mind, and
then, too, I do not care for him to make himself
completely ridiculous."</p>

<p>"You must know, my dear Bertrade, that I have
seen for some time past that Paul was gone on
Bijou, just as all the others are&mdash;for there is no
mistake about it, they all are; and the last few
days I have noticed that your abbé even has
begun to lose his indifference; don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"It is very possible!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am sure that he isn't going along
quite so peacefully in his worship of God as
formerly?"</p>

<p>"And that does not displease you either, grandmamma,
does it? Come, now, own it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, well; as long as it is just a little beneficial
upset for him, I don't mind; but I should not like
it to develop into anything serious&mdash;you understand
where I draw the line?"</p>

<p>"No, because I always pity all those who are
suffering from such little upsets&mdash;as you call them&mdash;even
when they are mild, I think they are calculated
to make people suffer greatly."</p>

<p>"You always see a darker side of things than I
do; at all events, I think that the idea of carrying
Paul off is a very excessive and unwise kind of
remedy. He keeps a strict guard over himself,
and no one suspects the true state of things except
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And all the others!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"Well, even if it be so, that is of no importance,
provided that Bijou does not suspect it herself.
Why do you not answer?"</p>

<p>"Because I am not of the same opinion as you,
grandmamma, and you do not like that as a rule,
particularly when it is a question of Bijou."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said, nothing else."</p>

<p>"Then, according to you, Bijou has noticed it
from&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"From the very first day."</p>

<p>"And even if that should be so, she cannot help
it! Besides, what danger does she run?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"Paul is honourable."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, and even if he were not, Bijou
would have nothing to fear for several reasons."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place&mdash;her own indifference.
Paul makes about as much impression on her, I
believe, as a table."</p>

<p>"Next?"</p>

<p>"Next? Why, that's all!"</p>

<p>"You said 'several reasons,'&mdash;you have given
me one; let us hear what the others are."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Madame de Rueille, "it was
just my way of speaking."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! you are not clever at telling untruths,
my dear Bertrade; I am pretty sure I know
what you thought!"</p>

<p>"I don't think you do."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll see! You were thinking that one
of the reasons why Bijou will never take any
notice of Paul is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because he is married."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; but you fancy, too, I am sure
of it, that Bijou is thinking of someone else?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Ah, you see! you don't answer now! Yes, you
believe, as your husband does&mdash;he told me so
two or three days ago&mdash;that she is madly in love
with young Giraud!"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmamma, what an unlikely supposition!
In the first place, Bijou is not, and
never will be, madly in love with anyone."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that when she marries, it will be in a
reasonable, calm sort of way, just as she does everything
else."</p>

<p>"But when will it be?"</p>

<p>"When will it be? Well, I do not know
exactly&mdash;soon, I think."</p>

<p>"Then you are saying that just at random?
You are speaking of the future in just a vague sort
of way?"</p>

<p>"The future always is vague, grandmamma,"
answered Madame de Rueille, smiling.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a whole week there was scarcely anything
else thought about but the rehearsals of the little
play, which was to be given the day after the
races.</p>

<p>The La Balues, the Juzencourts, and Madame
de Nézel, came to Bracieux nearly every day, and
M. de Clagny also, for he was very much interested
in the rehearsals. He acted as prompter when
Giraud, who had undertaken this post, was
occupied, and he appeared to be delighted whenever
he saw Bijou acting.</p>

<p>"Old Dubuisson" and M. Spiegel had been to
dinner several times, and Denyse, under the
pretext of letting him be more with his <i>fiancée</i>, had
persuaded the young professor to take a minor
rôle, in which he was execrable. Perhaps Jeanne
had noticed this, as the last few days she seemed
to be low-spirited, and she was not as even-tempered
as usual. Her father was astonished to
see her frequently with tears in her eyes, and for
no apparent motive, so that at last he declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that "she must be sickening for some illness or
another."</p>

<p>The Rueilles had not left Bracieux. Bertrade
felt that everyone was against her, as it were, and
had resigned herself to the inevitable; she had
quite given up the plan she had proposed, and was
now letting herself drift along, carried forward by
the society whirl in which she was living.</p>

<p>Young Bernès arrived one evening to invite the
marchioness and her guests to a paper-chase
which was being organised by his regiment. He,
himself, was to be hare, and all kinds of obstacles
were being put up; there had never been so fine
a paper-chase run in the forest.</p>

<p>Bijou at once persuaded her grandmother to
allow her to follow on horseback, M. de Rueille
and Jean de Blaye both answering for it that
nothing should happen to her. She was, besides,
very prudent, like most people who are accustomed
to riding, and who ride well, and she always
managed to avoid accidents, and not to run
useless risks.</p>

<p>Madame de Bracieux kept Hubert to dinner,
and in the evening, as she watched Denyse talking
to him, she said to Bertrade:</p>

<p>"It's very odd. It seems to me that Bijou is not
at all the same now with that young man. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
used to just give him an indifferent sort of bow,
and then leave him alone, and now it seems
almost as though she were 'gone' on him, to use
your elegant language. She has quite changed
her attitude towards him," continued the marchioness,
puzzled.</p>

<p>"And he, too, has quite changed his attitude
towards her," said Madame de Rueille.</p>

<p>"Yes, hasn't he? The first few times he came
to Bracieux, I was struck with his coolness towards
our sweet girl, whom everyone adores. He was
just simply polite to her, and that was all."</p>

<p>"At present, he is not very far gone, but there is
considerable progress; he is preparing to follow in
the pathway which has been beaten out by others."</p>

<p>"Just lately, when you were talking to me about
Bijou getting married, had you any idea in the
background?" asked the marchioness, looking at
Madame de Rueille.</p>

<p>Bertrade repeated the question without replying
to it.</p>

<p>"An idea in the background?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Were you, for instance, thinking that
Bijou was in love with this young Bernès?"</p>

<p>"I told you that same day, grandmamma, that
it is my belief Bijou is not in love, never has been
in love, and never will be in love with anyone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you had said that, as you say it now, I should
most certainly have protested. It would be impossible,
in my opinion, to be more absolutely and
completely mistaken than you are. Never to love
anyone?&mdash;Bijou!&mdash;when there never was anyone
who needed to be loved and petted as she
does."</p>

<p>"She needs to be loved and petted&mdash;yes, I grant
that; but she always requires people to love and
pet her, and she does not feel the need of loving
and petting others in her turn."</p>

<p>"In other words, she is selfish and cold-hearted?"
questioned the marchioness, her voice suddenly
taking a harsh tone. "The fact is, Bertrade, you
have a grudge against Bijou, because of the charm
there is about her: you are angry with her, because
no one can resist being fascinated by her, and
instead of blaming Paul, who is the real culprit, you
accuse the poor child in this cruel way."</p>

<p>"I do not accuse Bijou any more than I do
Paul, grandmamma: and I should be all the less
likely to accuse them, because I do not think that
we are exactly free agents in such matters; yes, I
know that you will be scandalised at my saying
such a thing&mdash;I can see that very well. You think
it is blasphemy, don't you? And yet, Heaven
knows that the thoughts which come to me sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
on this subject make me much more tolerant
and indulgent towards others&mdash;"</p>

<p>M. de Clagny approached the two ladies just at
this moment.</p>

<p>"What are you two plotting in this little
corner?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Madame de Bracieux; "we
were watching Bijou, who seems to be taming
your young friend Bernès."</p>

<p>"Taming him? Whatever do you mean by
that?" asked the count, turning round with a disturbed
look on his face.</p>

<p>"Well, I mean just what everyone means when
they make that remark! A week ago, when the
young man dined here with us, he was like an
icicle; well, I fancy that the thaw has set in."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed M. de Clagny, suddenly looking
serene again; "I forgot that he has a love
affair, and is so far gone that he fully intends to
marry this lady-love; and, as you can imagine,
his father is not delighted about it, by any
means." And then, in an absent-minded way, he
added, "I feel perfectly easy, as far as he is
concerned!"</p>

<p>"Easy!" exclaimed Madame de Bracieux in
astonishment "Why, easy! you would not like
Bijou to marry M. de Bernès, then? Why not?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;she is so young," he stammered out, in
a confused sort of way.</p>

<p>"How do you mean, so young? She is quite
old enough to marry; she will be twenty-two in
November, Bijou!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, Hubert is too young for her; he is
only a lad!"</p>

<p>"I should certainly prefer seeing her married to
a man rather more settled down; but, if she should
care for him, he is of good family, and is wealthy,
why should she not marry him as well as any
other?"</p>

<p>"Do you really think that Bijou cares for him?"
asked M. de Clagny anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it at all,"
answered the marchioness, laughing; "but anyhow,
what can that matter to you? I can understand
that Jean or Henry should be disturbed in
their minds&mdash;but you?" As he did not reply, she
went on: "It's a case of the dog in the manger:
he does not want the bone himself, but he does not
want the others to have it either. That is just
your case, my poor friend, for, I presume, you have
no idea of marrying Bijou yourself?"</p>

<p>He answered in a joking way, but there was a
troubled look on his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to me, it is an idea that I should like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
very much; but she would not; therefore it amounts
to the same thing!"</p>

<p>Bijou came up to them just at that moment, gliding
along with her light step. She was followed by
young Bernès, who looked vexed about something.</p>

<p>"I cannot, really, mademoiselle," he was saying,
"I assure you that I cannot get away from my
friends that day."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can; mustn't he, grandmamma?"
asked Denyse merrily, "mustn't M. de Bernès come
to dinner here on the day of the paper-chase?
He is to be the hare, and the start is to be from
the 'Cinq-Tranchées'&mdash;it is only a mile from
Bracieux at the farthest."</p>

<p>Madame de Bracieux was examining the young
officer with interest, and there was a kindly look in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," she said, "he must come here
to dinner; we shall all be so pleased."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, madame, to invite me, but
I was explaining to Mademoiselle de Courtaix
that on that day, after the paper-chase, which the
regiment is getting up for the benefit of the residents,
I have promised faithfully to dine with
several of my friends." And glancing, in spite
of himself, at Bijou, he added, "And I regret it
now, more than I can tell you!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning round on her high heels, Denyse glided
off again to the other end of the long room, where
she was greeted by Pierrot with reproachful
words.</p>

<p>"It was very mean of you to slope away from us
like that, you know!" exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>M. de Jonzac, who was playing billiards with the
abbé, was also keeping one ear open to catch what
was going on round him. He now protested
against the way in which Pierrot expressed himself,
even supposing that the reproach itself were
just.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," answered his son, "it's quite true
that I'm not over-particular about what words
I use, but that doesn't prevent what I said being
true; and the others said it too, just now; I wasn't
the only one."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said Giraud, who was standing
near the large bay-window, looking out at the sky,
"you said yesterday that you liked shooting stars&mdash;I
have never seen so many as there are to-night."</p>

<p>"Really?" replied Denyse, going to the window,
and leaning her arms on the ledge, side by side
with the tutor, "are there as many as all that?
What's that to the left?" she asked, bending forward.
"I can see something white on the terrace."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is Mademoiselle Dubuisson, who is strolling
about with her father and M. Spiegel."</p>

<p>"Ah! supposing we went out to them&mdash;shall we?"</p>

<p>Giraud led the way at once, only too happy to
go out for a stroll on this beautiful starry night.
When they were near the terrace, she stopped
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall be <i>de trop</i>," she said; "they
may be talking of private affairs. Let us go to the
chestnut avenue, and they'll come to us if they
want to."</p>

<p>She descended the marble steps, and they were
soon in the dark avenue, under the thick chestnut
trees. The young man had followed her, his heart
beating with excitement, almost beside himself
with joy. They walked along for some little time
without speaking, and then at last Bijou looked
up, trying to catch a glimpse of the sky between
the branches of the trees.</p>

<p>"We shall not see much of the shooting stars
here," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Giraud, who did not want
to leave this shady walk, where he had Bijou all to
himself, "we can see them all the same. Look,
there's one, did you see it?"</p>

<p>"Not distinctly, and not long enough to be able
to wish anything."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"To wish anything? but what?"</p>

<p>"Oh! anything. Why! do you mean to say
you did not know that when you see a shooting
star you ought to wish something?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not know. And does your wish get
fulfilled?"</p>

<p>"They say so."</p>

<p>"Well, then, mademoiselle, have you a wish
quite ready this time, so that you will not be taken
unawares?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly, I have one; but it can never be
realised."</p>

<p>"Ah! I dare not ask you what."</p>

<p>"I should like to be quite different from what I
am," she replied, very gently. "Yes, I should like
to be a very pretty girl, in quite humble circumstances,
so that I need not be obliged to go
into society, and so that I could marry just whom
I liked. I should like to be, in fact, happy according
to my own idea of things, without troubling
anything about social prejudices and conventionalities."</p>

<p>"Why should you wish that?" he asked, in a
voice that trembled slightly.</p>

<p>"So that I should have the right to love anyone
who loved me. I mean, openly; without having
to keep it to myself." And then she added, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
very low voice, "And without reproaching myself
for it."</p>

<p>She was walking quite close to him, so close,
that their shoulders touched at every step.</p>

<p>Giraud was quite agitated with conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>"You say that&mdash;as if&mdash;as if&mdash;you did care for
someone?" he stammered out.</p>

<p>He knew that she had turned her face towards
him, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>Just at this moment a screech-owl, which was
perched quite near them amongst the thick, dark
looking foliage of the trees, gave a sudden, wailing,
cry, which startled Bijou. She knocked against
Giraud as she jumped aside in her fright, and he
instinctively put his arms round her. Her soft,
perfumed hair brushed against his lips, making
him lose his head completely. He forgot everything,
and, utterly oblivious of all that separated
him from the young girl, he drew her closer to him
in a passionate embrace, and murmured tenderly:</p>

<p>"Denyse!"</p>

<p>She let him do as he liked, without offering any
resistance, but when, at last, he set her free, she
said, in a tender, plaintive tone:</p>

<p>"Oh! how wrong it was of you to have done
that, how wrong of you!" And then she hid her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
face in her hands, and he could hear that she was
crying.</p>

<p>He tried to console her, but she would not allow
him to stay.</p>

<p>"No, go away, please," she said: "they will be
wondering where you are. I shall come in directly,
when I am myself again."</p>

<p>As he was starting off in the direction of the
terrace, she called him back.</p>

<p>"Not that way," she said. "Go round by the
pool. Don't let them think you have come from
here."</p>

<p>"Let me stay another minute, just to ask you
to forgive me. Let me kiss those little hands that
I love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please go! Please go!" she said, in a tone
that sounded as though she mistrusted herself.</p>

<p>Before turning into the walk that led round by
the pool, Giraud stopped a minute to get another
glimpse of Denyse, who, in her light dress, looked
like a white spot against the dark background of
the trees. He could hear that she was still crying.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Is that you, Bijou?" asked Jean de Blaye,
coming forward in the thick darkness.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked the young girl, drawing
herself up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is I&mdash;Jean! Why, do you mean to say that
you won't even do me the honour of recognising
my voice. What are you doing out here in this
pitch darkness?"</p>

<p>"I am taking a stroll."</p>

<p>"All alone?"</p>

<p>"I came out to join the Dubuissons, but I
thought afterwards that it was better not to disturb
them, and so I came here all alone."</p>

<p>"It must be quite a change for you to be alone,
isn't it? And what in the world do you do when
you are all by yourself?"</p>

<p>"I think."</p>

<p>"Oh! what a big word!"</p>

<p>"Well, I dream dreams, if you like that
better?"</p>

<p>"Well I never! That's what I never should
have thought you would do. They are surely not
in the least like ordinary dreams&mdash;yours?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Because dreams are usually incoherent, strange
and quite improbable."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, your dreams must be admirably sensible
and reasonable; they must resemble you."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"For what?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, for the pleasant things you are saying."</p>

<p>"Oh! they are not exactly pleasant things; they
are true, though. Besides, I have not come here
just to say pleasant things to you, but to talk to
you seriously."</p>

<p>"Seriously?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I have undertaken a mission for some
one else. I have promised to speak to you to the
best of my ability in the name of some one who
did not care to speak for himself."</p>

<p>"Who is this some one else?"</p>

<p>"Henry! He begged me to ask you whether
you would authorise him to ask grandmamma for
your hand?"</p>

<p>"My hand! Henry?" she exclaimed, and her
accent expressed her bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Is that so very astonishing?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!&mdash;it is as though he were my brother&mdash;Henry!"</p>

<p>"Well, but he is not your brother, nevertheless;
therefore do not let us trouble about him as a
brother, but as a lover. What is your answer?"</p>

<p>"My answer! why does Henry apply to me
first? Instead of asking my permission to speak
to grandmamma, he ought to have asked grandmamma's
permission to speak to me."</p>

<p>"There; didn't I say that you were a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
excellent little person, always knowing the correct
thing, and all the rest of it!"</p>

<p>"Is it wrong of me to be like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! it is not wrong&mdash;on the contrary! only
it is a trifle embarrassing. Tell me, now that I
have made this mistake in speaking to you first,
will you give me an answer? or must I set to
work to put matters right again, by applying now
to grandmamma, who in her turn will apply to
you, etc., etc."</p>

<p>"No, I will give you my answer."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let me finish my rigmarole. Count
Henry de Bracieux was born on the 22nd of
January, 1870. His entire fortune, until after the
death of his grandmother, consists of twenty-four
thousand pounds, which amount brings in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! you needn't trouble to tell me about
money matters; in the first place, they don't
interest me, and then, as I do not wish to marry
Henry, it is useless to tell me all that!"</p>

<p>"Ah! you do not wish to marry him!
Why?"</p>

<p>"For several reasons, the best of which is that
I know him too well."</p>

<p>"It certainly is not very flattering, this reason of
yours!"</p>

<p>"I mean what I said just now, that, living with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Henry as I have done for the last four years, I
consider him as a brother."</p>

<p>"Then that applies to me, too; do you look
upon me, too, as a brother?" asked Jean de
Blaye, trying to speak in an indifferent tone.</p>

<p>"You, oh, no! not at all; you are thirty-five at
least!"</p>

<p>"No, thirty-three."</p>

<p>"Only that?&mdash;ah, well, it's all the same! you
don't seem to me like a brother!"</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, thinking, whilst he
stood waiting, with a sort of vague hope.</p>

<p>"You seem to me more like an uncle," she said
at last.</p>

<p>"Oh!" remarked Jean, with an accent that
betrayed his vexation, "that is very nice."</p>

<p>"You are annoyed with me for saying that?"
she asked, in her pretty, coaxing way.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all! I am delighted, on the contrary;
it is very satisfactory, for, with you, one
knows exactly what to count on; and then, if one
has any delusions, well, they don't have to hang
fire."</p>

<p>"You had delusions&mdash;what were they?"</p>

<p>"No, I hadn't one of any kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can tell by your voice; you speak in
a sharp, bitter, irritated way. Tell me why you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
are so bad-tempered all in a minute?" she asked,
in a coaxing tone, leaning against him, and looking
up into his face.</p>

<p>He stepped back from her as he answered:</p>

<p>"When one is not very good to start with, and
one has trouble, it makes one go to the bad; it
is inevitable!"</p>

<p>"And you have trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it very bad?"</p>

<p>"Well, quite bad enough, thank you!"</p>

<p>"Poor Jean; things don't go as you want them
to, then?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What are you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Why, about&mdash;oh, you know very well! I told
you the other evening!"</p>

<p>"That again!" he said, getting more and more
worked up; "how foolish you are!"</p>

<p>"What, do you mean that you do not care for
Madame de Nézel?" exclaimed Bijou.</p>

<p>"Madame de Nézel is a charming woman," he
stammered out, in an embarrassed way. "She is
an excellent friend whom I like very much, very
much indeed, but not in the way you
imagine."</p>

<p>"Ah! so much the worse for you; she is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
widow, and she is rich; she would just have suited
you. Well, then, you like someone else?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Someone you cannot marry?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Why? isn't she rich enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it is not that; if she had not a farthing
it would be all the same to me; it is the other way
round, I am not rich enough for her, and then&mdash;she
would not have me."</p>

<p>"You do not know; you ought to tell her that
you love her."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course&mdash;try that, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, Bijou, I love you with all my
heart&mdash;but I know that there is no hope, and, unfortunate
wretch that I am, I dare not even ask for
any."</p>

<p>"You love <i>me</i>!" she exclaimed, in deep distress,
and then, stopping short, she repeated: "<i>you</i>&mdash;Jean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and what about you? you detest me, do
you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jean, how can you say such things? You
know very well that I love you, though not in the
way you want me to, or as I should like to be able
to, but very much, all the same; indeed I do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>She put her hand on his shoulder, obliging him
to stand still, and then passed her hand over his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jean," she exclaimed, in great grief, "tears,
and all because of me! Oh, please, don't&mdash;no,
indeed you must not; do you hear me, Jean?"</p>

<p>He took the little hand, which was stroking his
face, and kissed it passionately. Then putting
Bijou, who was clinging to him, gently aside, he
left her abruptly, and strode off alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Then</span>, you really mean that you are going?"
asked Bijou sorrowfully, as Jeanne Dubuisson
folded her dresses into the tray of a long basket
trunk.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the young girl, absorbed in
what she was doing, and without even looking up.
"I have been here a long time; it would be taking
advantage to stay longer, you know."</p>

<p>"You know very well that it would be nothing
of the kind; and it was almost settled that you
were to stay until Monday, and then, all at once,
you changed your mind. What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing at all. What do you imagine
could be the matter?"</p>

<p>"If I knew, I should not ask you. Come, now!
what can it be? you don't seem to find things too
dull?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bijou, however could I find things dull?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you might; and yet, you see your
<i>fiancé</i> almost as much as when you were at Pont-sur-Loire."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; let us reckon, shall we? M. Spiegel
went to Paris for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday;
Tuesday he came here to dinner with M. Dubuisson;
Wednesday he came alone; Thursday he
managed to swallow the confirmation luncheon,
poor man; Friday he was here to dinner; and
every day we have been rehearsing our play either
before or after dinner, so that he has never been
away from you."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true," answered Jeanne reluctantly;
"but if he has not been away from me, he has
scarcely troubled about me at all."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"How? Oh! it is simple enough! He has
only troubled about you; he has talked to no one
but you."</p>

<p>"To me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to you&mdash;there! I may as well own it,
Bijou; I am jealous&mdash;frightfully jealous."</p>

<p>"Jealous of whom? Of me?" asked Denyse,
with a startled look.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dubuisson nodded, and then she
proceeded to explain, whilst the tears rose to her
eyes:</p>

<p>"You must forgive me for telling you this. I
can see that I am causing you pain, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
better, is it not, to tell the truth, than to let you
suspect all kinds of wrong reasons? You are not
angry with me?"</p>

<p>"No; not at all!" And then Bijou added
sorrowfully: "It is you who ought rather to be
angry with me. But you are mistaken, I assure
you! M. Spiegel, who is very polite, has taken
notice of me simply because I am the grandchild
of his hostess, and not for any other reason."</p>

<p>"He has taken notice of you for the same
reason which makes everyone take notice of you&mdash;just
because you are adorable, and you know that
very well!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was quite certain that he would be
fascinated by you, just as all the others are,
and I was very silly not to have foreseen what would
happen. I counted too much on his affection&mdash;I
thought that he loved me just as I love him&mdash;I
was mistaken, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Then I shall not see anything more of you?
You will avoid all opportunities of meeting
me?"</p>

<p>"No; we shall spend the whole of the day together
at the paper-chase."</p>

<p>"As you will be driving, and I shall be riding, I
shall not be much in your way."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Bijou was silent for a minute, and then she began
again in an anxious tone:</p>

<p>"You don't think, at any rate, that it is my
fault&mdash;what has happened?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Jeanne; "I don't think anything,
except that you are a charming girl, and
I am merely common-place. Bijou, dear, don't
make yourself wretched about it, please!"</p>

<p>"I should be so unhappy if I were not to see
anything more of you!"</p>

<p>"But you will see me! The day after to-morrow
I am coming back to Bracieux for your
play. I must, you know, considering that we are
both acting, M. Spiegel and I."</p>

<p>"Why do you say, 'M. Spiegel'? Why do
you not say Franz like you always do? Are you
angry with him?"</p>

<p>"On Saturday," continued Jeanne, without
answering Bijou's question, "we shall see each
other at the races, and then again at the Tourvilles'
dance; you see we shall scarcely be separated
at all."</p>

<p>"All the same it won't be as though you were
staying here," answered Bijou, with a sorrowful
look, "and, then, too, I know very well that you
are going away feeling different towards me."</p>

<p>Just at this moment the maid entered the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madame wishes to speak to mademoiselle in
the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"In the drawing-room at this time of day!"
exclaimed Bijou, in surprise.</p>

<p>"M. de Clagny is there."</p>

<p>"Oh! very well! Say that I am coming at
once."</p>

<p>"Will you go down with me?" asked Bijou,
turning to Mademoiselle Dubuisson.</p>

<p>"No, I want to finish packing my trunk, as it is
to be sent to Pont-sur-Loire after luncheon."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A quarter of an hour later, Bijou returned in
great glee.</p>

<p>"Ah! you don't know something. We are going
to spend the evening together to-day!"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Guess!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know. At the theatre?"</p>

<p>"Right! How did you guess that?"</p>

<p>"Because you said over and over again before
M. de Clagny how much you wanted to go to
that performance organised by the <i>Dames de
France</i>. I suppose he has offered you a
box?"</p>

<p>"Two boxes! yes, just imagine it; two beautiful big
boxes, each one for six persons! And so we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
at once arranged with your father that you are to
come&mdash;M. Spiegel as well, of course&mdash;I forgot
to tell you that they are there&mdash;your father
and M. Spiegel. M. de Clagny brought them with
him."</p>

<p>"But three of us will be too many for you,"
began Jeanne.</p>

<p>"When I have just told you that there are
twelve places! Come, now&mdash;Grandmamma and
I, that makes two, and you three, that makes five;
there are seven places over, and no one wants to
come."</p>

<p>"The Rueilles?"</p>

<p>"Paul, but not Bertrade; that makes six.
Neither Jean nor Henry are coming, nor Uncle
Alexis either, and Pierrot has got into a scrape.
Then there is M. de Clagny, and I thought of
offering a place to M. Giraud, so that makes us
eight altogether."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dubuisson did not speak, and
Bijou went on:</p>

<p>"You do not care about spending this evening
with us, or, rather, with me, and so you are trying
to find a pretext?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I am not trying to find anything:
besides, since it is all arranged with papa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is quite settled. I had invited M. de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Bernès, too; but he makes out that he cannot come,
because he is going with his friends."</p>

<p>"Where did you see M. de Bernès?"</p>

<p>"In the drawing-room just a minute ago. Ah,
of course you did not know. He has come to
bring the invitation for M. Giraud. Jean wrote to
him for it, because M. Giraud wanted to go to the
paper-chase, and as there are refreshments offered
by the officers to their guests, grandmamma is so
scrupulous that she would not take him without an
invitation."</p>

<p>"Then M. de Bernès is staying to luncheon,
too?"</p>

<p>"No, he has gone again; he is the hare, you
know, and the meeting-place is at the cross-roads
at three o'clock; it is quite near for us, but
for those who come from Pont-sur-Loire, it's a
good step."</p>

<p>"What time do we start?"</p>

<p>"At half-past two the carriages, and a quarter
past two those who are riding&mdash;Do you know&mdash;I
feel inclined to dress before luncheon, so
that I should not have to think any more about it."</p>

<p>"You have half an hour."</p>

<p>"Well, you are ready. Come with me while I
dress, will you?"</p>

<p>Jeanne followed Bijou in a docile way, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
latter hurried along the corridors, singing as she
went.</p>

<p>"You are always gay," remarked Jeanne, "but this
morning it seems to me that you are particularly
joyful. What is it that makes you so?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing! I am delighted about the paper-chase,
and the theatre; then, too, it is beautiful
weather, the sky is so blue, the flowers so fresh and
beautiful, it seems to me delicious to be alive&mdash;but
that's all!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's something at any rate."</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Bijou, pushing Mademoiselle
Dubuisson into a cosy arm-chair.</p>

<p>Jeanne sat down, and looked round at the pretty
room. The walls were hung with pale pink
cretonne, with a design of large white poppies.
The ceiling, too, was pink, and the Louis Seize
furniture was lacquered pink. There were flowers
everywhere, in strange-shaped glass vases, and the
air was laden with a delicious, penetrating perfume,
a mixture of chypre, iris, and a scent like new-mown
hay.</p>

<p>Jeanne inhaled this perfume with delight.</p>

<p>"What do you put in your room to make it
smell like this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Does it smell of something? I do not smell
anything&mdash;anyhow, I don't use scent for it,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
answered Bijou, sniffing the air around her with
all her might.</p>

<p>"Oh! why, that's incredible!" exclaimed Jeanne
astounded. "But do you mean truly that you do
not put anything at all to scent your room?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing."</p>

<p>Denyse was moving about, getting everything
she required before changing her dress. She was
not long in putting on her habit, and as she stood
before the long glass, putting a few finishing
touches to her toilette, Jeanne could not help
admiring her.</p>

<p>"How well it fits you!" she said. "It looks
as though it had been moulded on you&mdash;it really
is perfection! And then, too, you have such a
pretty figure!"</p>

<p>Denyse was just putting a pearl pin into her
white cravat. The point broke with a little sharp
click.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Jeanne, "what a pity!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," answered Bijou, "for it was
not up to much. If I win my bet with M. de
Bernès, I will let him give me a strong pin,"
and then, with a laugh, she added: "and not an
expensive one, so that it will not seem like a
present."</p>

<p>"You have made a bet with M. de Bernès?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have to choose your present?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Is there any harm in it?"</p>

<p>"Harm? No! but it is odd."</p>

<p>"Well! you are like grandmamma. She was
scandalised, grandmamma was."</p>

<p>"Well, it is odd, you know! And what have
you been betting&mdash;you and M. de Bernès?"</p>

<p>"I, that there would be, at least, one accident at
the paper-chase; and he, that there would not be
one at all."</p>

<p>"Well, but that's very possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! it is not very possible! There always
are accidents; it would be the first paper-chase
without one. Take notice that it is merely a
question of a fall&mdash;just a simple fall&mdash;the person
falls down, and is picked up again. I do not predict
that anyone will be killed, you understand?"</p>

<p>"Well, don't you go and have a fall, at any
rate."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to me!" said Bijou, her eyes shining
with merriment, "there is no danger. Patatras
has never been stronger on his legs. Pass me the
scissors, will you, please, they are just by the
side of you?"</p>

<p>Jeanne watched her admiringly as she stood in
front of the long glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is not a single crease anywhere in your
habit, and what a pretty figure you have, really,
Bijou."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When, at a quarter past two, punctual, as usual,
Bijou appeared on the stone steps in front of the
half-door, she found Henry de Bracieux there,
Jean de Blaye, and Pierrot. M. de Rueille had
not yet come downstairs.</p>

<p>The horses, which had been waiting a few
minutes, were somewhat restless, as the flies were
worrying them. Patatras alone was perfectly
calm, nibbling at the hazel tree, and looking peaceably
at what was going on around him.</p>

<p>Presently Bertrade opened a window, and called
out:</p>

<p>"Don't wait for Paul. He is only just beginning
to dress. He will catch you up."</p>

<p>"Would you like to start, Bijou?" proposed
Jean.</p>

<p>"I feel almost inclined to let you start without
me," she answered, in an undecided way. "Your
three horses are jumping about like mad things;
they will excite Patatras, who is quite peaceful
now. Start on, at any rate&mdash;I will join you out
there. Nothing annoys me more than to ride a
horse that is pulling so that you can hardly hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
him in, and that is what I should have to put up
with, for certain, if I start with you."</p>

<p>"Then you are going to wait for Paul?" asked
Henry, looking bad-tempered.</p>

<p>Bijou pointed to the carriages, which were just
coming out of the stable-yard.</p>

<p>"No, I am going to escort grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Well, that is just what will rouse your horse
up," said Jean de Blaye.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Don't you think I know my horse?
Anyhow, all I ask you is to start off, and not to
trouble yourselves about me."</p>

<p>"You are charming, really," observed Pierrot,
moving towards his pony, and then turning towards
the others, he added majestically, although,
in a vexed tone: "Let us leave her, then, as she
does not want to go with us."</p>

<p>"I think that's the only choice left us in the
matter," answered Jean, half vexed and half laughing,
as he mounted his horse.</p>

<p>Just as they were all three disappearing round
the bend of the drive, M. de Clagny came out of
the hall. He was looking to see whether his mail-coach
had been put in, and was astonished to find
Bijou there.</p>

<p>"How nice you look in that red habit," he said,
in his admiration. "Generally, red makes anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
look pale, but you&mdash;why, it makes you look rosier
than ever, if that is possible."</p>

<p>When he heard that she was going to accompany
the carriages as far as the meeting-place he was
perfectly happy.</p>

<p>The marchioness soon arrived, followed by all
the others. She got into the landau with the
Dubuissons and M. Spiegel, whilst M. de Clagny
took on his coach Madame de Rueille, the children,
Abbé Courteil, M. de Jonzac, and M. Giraud.
The latter was hypnotised to such a degree by
Bijou, who was waiting, ready mounted, for the
others to start, that he almost fell off the coach
instead of sitting down.</p>

<p>The sun was shining brilliantly when they at
last set out on their journey. M. de Clagny was
much more taken up with Bijou than with the four
horses he was driving. He watched her trotting in
front of him, near to the carriage in which the
marchioness was driving.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had seen her on horseback,
and she seemed to him incomparably pretty
and elegant. Whilst he was thus watching her
with singular attention, Madame de Bracieux called
out to her from the landau:</p>

<p>"What a horribly hot day it is, Bijou dear. I don't
like to see you in this blazing sunshine!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Denyse turned round with a very rosy face.</p>

<p>"Nor do I either, grandmamma, I don't like to
see myself in it at all!" She was silent a
moment and then she continued: "When we
come across Jean, Henry, and Pierrot, I shall
desert you."</p>

<p>"Do you think we shall come across them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, certainly! They are going along
through the wood, almost the same road that we
are taking with the carriages. They are only some
twelve or fifteen yards away from us; I heard them
a little while ago. As soon as I see them I shall
leave you!"</p>

<p>M. de Clagny called to Bijou in order to warn
her about a hundred things to avoid. In the
coppice she was to beware of the branches; that
very morning he had been almost taken out of his
saddle when galloping in the wood. She was to
take care, too, of the burrows&mdash;the wood was full
of them; and then she was not to jump all in a
heap, as it were; she must never do that, but
always remember to lean forward or hold back.</p>

<p>She listened to all this advice smilingly, and
with a certain affectionate deference.</p>

<p>"How good you are, Bijou!" he finished up with
at last. "How is it you do not tell your old friend
who worries you so to go about his business?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Just at this moment a horseman crossed the
road about two hundred yards in front of the
carriages, and entered the forest.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the count, "there's Bernès throwing
his paper! he's gone in for the right way of
doing things, that is, to go along the whole route
first in the opposite direction, dropping the paper,
then afterwards one has only to fly along, without
troubling about anything."</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked Bijou.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes to three," answered Bertrade,
looking at her watch. "We shall get to the meet
much too soon."</p>

<p>M. de Clagny let his horses walk, and Bijou
caught up with the landau again, and began talking
to Jeanne. Suddenly she bent her head as though
listening to something.</p>

<p>"Ah, there they are!" she exclaimed. "I can
hear them!"</p>

<p>"Whom do you hear?" asked the marchioness.</p>

<p>"Why, the others; they are there, and I am
going to them. Good-bye, grandmamma." She
crossed the ditch at the side of the road, and
then pulled up, and, throwing a kiss to Jeanne,
called out: "Good-bye to you, too."</p>

<p>But the landau was some distance on, and the
coach was just passing. Giraud, seated at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
back with the children, was the only one who was
looking in Bijou's direction, and it was he who
received the farewell kiss she threw to her
friend.</p>

<p>"Are you sure to find them?" asked the count,
turning round on the box-seat.</p>

<p>"Why, they are only a few steps away," she
answered, pointing to the wood. "I have just
seen Henry."</p>

<p>Whereupon she disappeared in the thicket, and
M. de Clagny looked after her, with an anxious
expression on his face.</p>

<p>As soon as she had found a path, Bijou set off at a
gallop, going straight ahead, listening eagerly, and
looking out as far as she could see in front of her
through the gloom of the wood.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly she turned abruptly aside, and
rode some little distance into the brushwood, where
she remained without moving, and doing all she
could to prevent Patatras from making the dead
branches crackle under his feet.</p>

<p>Along the path which she had just left came
Henry de Bracieux, Jean de Blaye, and Pierrot.</p>

<p>When they were almost level with the spot
where Denyse was hiding, they pulled up to wait
for a horse that they heard galloping quite near
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whatever have you been doing?" asked Henry,
as M. de Rueille appeared in sight. "It is quite
ten minutes ago since we saw you at the bottom of
the Belles-Feuilles road."</p>

<p>"Where is Bijou?" asked M. de Rueille anxiously,
without replying to Henry's question.</p>

<p>"She left us in the lurch, and started with the
carriages," answered Pierrot contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Rueille, in a disappointed tone.
And then, turning to his brother-in-law, he
continued: "What have I been doing? well, I
stopped a minute or two to speak to Bernès, who was
with his lady-love; she had come in a cab to a
quiet spot, where no one would think of meeting her,
just for the sake of seeing Bernès for two or three
minutes; they cannot go a day without seeing each
other. She's a very pretty girl."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jean de Blaye, "and a sweet little
thing too; and she's been well brought up."</p>

<p>"I had never seen her so near before."</p>

<p>"Now that your horse has had a rest, Paul, we
had better get on our way, or we shall miss the
start."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered M. de Rueille, setting off again;
"but we have plenty of time. Bernès is behind
me, you know."</p>

<p>As soon as they had gone on some distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Bijou came out of the brushwood again. Her
complexion was wonderfully brilliant, and
eyes shone with the deep blue flame which
sometimes made their usually gentle expression
disconcerting.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Hubert de Bernès stayed a few minutes, after
M. de Rueille had left him, talking to Lisette
Renaud.</p>

<p>"Well, then, it is settled?" asked the pretty
actress. "In spite of the dinner, you will come
early to the theatre?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You will stay in my <i>loge</i>?"</p>

<p>"No! I must appear in the theatre."</p>

<p>"But you have a horror of <i>La Vivandière</i>,&mdash;which
I can quite understand&mdash;and yet you are
going to see it again?"</p>

<p>When Bijou had invited Bernès to come into
Madame de Bracieux's box, he had refused, knowing
that it would grieve Lisette to see him there.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Courtaix was very well known
in Pont-sur-Loire, and was greatly admired by
society women and those who were not society
women. Her costumes were imitated, and her
wonderful beauty envied, for it was said that she
was quite irresistible. The young lieutenant was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
perfectly aware that he, too, had been fascinated by
her charms the last few days. His affection for
Lisette had hitherto rendered him proof against
all such fascination. He was passionately fond of
the faithful and devoted young actress, who, for
the last two years, had loved him so truly, and
who would never accept from him any presents
but flowers or trifling souvenirs, which were of no
pecuniary value.</p>

<p>Lisette earned some thirty pounds a month at
the Pont-sur-Loire theatre, and she had declared
that she would not receive from him any presents
whatever of any value. He had not dared to
insist, as he had feared to wound her feelings, or to
cause an estrangement between them. She was
very beautiful, but he loved her more for her
qualities of mind and heart than for her beauty.</p>

<p>Since he had begun to pay attention to Bijou,
whom, until now, he had scarcely ever noticed, he
had felt greatly disturbed. It was all in vain that
he had said to himself, over and over again,
that Lisette, with her large expressive eyes, her
delicate complexion, her dazzlingly white teeth,
and her beautiful, elegant figure, was far prettier
than Mademoiselle de Courtaix. In spite of all
this, Bijou's violet eyes, her curly hair, and tempting
lips, haunted him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Lisette, although she had no idea that her
happiness was in danger, felt a sort of uneasiness
take possession of her, and a vague sadness come
over her. She could not understand why Bernès
should answer her question in such a harsh way.</p>

<p>"I shall have to see <i>La Vivandière</i> again
because, in order to refuse a seat that was offered
me in a box, I was obliged to say that I had promised
to go with some of my brother-officers to
the theatre."</p>

<p>"Who was it who offered you a place?"</p>

<p>"An old lady whom you do not know&mdash;Madame
de Bracieux&mdash;you are much wiser now, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"Madame de Bracieux," she said, feeling sad,
without knowing exactly why she should feel so.
"She is the grandmother of Mademoiselle de
Courtaix."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" he asked, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, just as everyone else knows it in Pont-sur-Loire."</p>

<p>"In the meantime," he said, in an irritated tone,
"I shall miss the meet if I don't look out."</p>

<p>"Don't stay," said Lisette regretfully, "enjoy
yourself&mdash;and I shall see you this evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;this evening." Just as he was entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the wood, he turned round in his saddle, and
called out: "Above all, take care that they do
not see you; don't go where the carriages
are."</p>

<p>And then, taking the path along which Bijou
had gone, some little time before, he put his horse
to a sharp gallop, in order to make up for lost time.
Suddenly he stopped short, trying to distinguish
something which he saw some distance ahead of
him.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said to himself, "if it isn't a horse
without its rider!&mdash;some fine gentleman has got
himself landed already." As he drew nearer, he
saw that the horse had a lady's saddle, and he
uttered a cry as he perceived Bijou lying on her
back on the grass to the right of the path. One
of her arms was stretched out crosswise, and the
other was down at her side, her eyes were closed,
and her lips parted.</p>

<p>Bernès sprang to the ground, fastened his horse
up, and then taking Denyse in his arms, tried to
prop her up against a tree. When, however, the
girl's head fell languidly on his shoulder, he drew
her to him, and, bending over her, kissed her soft
curly hair over and over again.</p>

<p>"Bijou, dear Bijou!" he murmured, in spite of
himself; "listen to me, will you? answer me&mdash;speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to me&mdash;I am so wretched seeing you like
this."</p>

<p>At the end of two or three minutes Denyse gave
a very gentle sigh, and opened her eyes slowly.</p>

<p>At the sight of Bernès her grave face lighted up
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she murmured, "wasn't it stupid, that
fall?"</p>

<p>"How did you manage it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I fancy my horse put his foot
in a hole."</p>

<p>"And you went up in the air?"</p>

<p>"That was it," she answered, laughing.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not the least bit in the world!" And then she
added pensively: "It's very nice of you to trouble
about me, and all the more so as you do not like
me, I know."</p>

<p>Hubert de Bernès turned as red as a tomato.</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle, how can you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do think so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, but," he began, in an anxious voice,
"tell me at least whatever makes you imagine such
a thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everything and nothing; it would take too
long to explain. Well, this morning, for instance,
when I asked you to go with us to the theatre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
you looked quite annoyed, and you refused; oh,
yes&mdash;out and out. Well, why did you refuse?"</p>

<p>"But, mademoiselle, I&mdash;I assure you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There you see, you cannot find a word to say,
not even the most common-place excuse."</p>

<p>Shaking her head so that her hair came down
and fell over the young man's shoulder and against
his face, she went on talking, laughing all the time,
and still leaning against him for support.</p>

<p>"I don't mind, though, at all, for whether you
want to or not now, you will have to come with us
to the theatre; you cannot refuse."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no but about it. I will have that
now for the payment of our bet."</p>

<p>"Our bet?"</p>

<p>"Well, did we not make a bet? I, that there
would be an accident, because there always are
accidents, you know; and you, that there would not
be one at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, it seems to me that this is one. Don't
you consider it enough&mdash;my accident? Well, I
wonder what more you want?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's true," he managed to stammer out.
"What an idiot I am! the fact is, I was so
frightened&mdash;if you only knew."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked up at him with a sweet expression
in her beautiful eyes, and he was fascinated by her
sweetness.</p>

<p>"Thank you again," she said, holding out her
little hand to him; "thank you for looking after
me; and now you had better go on quickly."</p>

<p>"But can you mount again?"</p>

<p>"Not just yet&mdash;I feel a sort of stiffness, and a
tired feeling all over. No, will you go on and tell
M. de Clagny to come with his carriage and fetch
me; don't say anything about it to the others;
I don't want grandmamma to know."</p>

<p>As Hubert de Bernès was holding her hand
pressed against his lips, Bijou went on impatiently:</p>

<p>"Go now, quickly! ask M. de Clagny to
leave his carriage on the road, and explain to
him that he will find me in the wood near
the road, just where I left him a little while
ago. And will you fasten Patatras to a tree
before you go away? Thank you!" She looked
at him again with her sweetest expression, and
asked once more: "It's settled, then, for this
evening, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's quite settled," he answered.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of sight, she lay down
again in exactly the same position in which Bernès
had found her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later the sound of carriage-wheels was
heard along the road, and M. de Clagny, getting
down from his coach, entered the wood. At the
sight of Bijou, he uttered a cry of horror, and,
rushing to her, took her in his arms in his anxiety
and anguish.</p>

<p>"Bijou, my love! my darling! dear little
Bijou!" And then, like Bernès, he added: "listen
to me, Bijou dear; answer me; please speak to
me!"</p>

<p>He kissed her soft hair, and drew her closer and
closer to him, until at last she opened her eyes,
and looked up at him with her pretty, innocent
expression; and then, as though she were going to
sleep again, she murmured, as she laid her head
confidingly against him:</p>

<p>"Ah, you are so nice to me; and I am so happy
like this! I should like to stay here always!"</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span> in!" called out Bijou.</p>

<p>She was standing in front of the glass, brushing
her hair leisurely. The more she brushed, the
more her hair curled, and scented the atmosphere
at the same time with a delicate perfume.</p>

<p>"The Count de Clagny has come, mademoiselle,
to ask how you are?" said the maid.</p>

<p>"How I am?"</p>

<p>"After the accident yesterday."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! I had forgotten it!" And, going to
the window, she asked: "Is he driving?"</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle, he came on horseback; but
he is in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, I will go down!"</p>

<p>As soon as the domestic had gone, Bijou slipped
on another <i>peignoir</i> quickly. She then put on
some pink kid slippers without heels, which made
her little feet look delightfully droll, and with her
hair hanging loosely down over the frilled collar
of her long, loose dress, she ran downstairs to M.
de Clagny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>On seeing her enter the room, the count rose
quickly. His face looked drawn and tired, and
there was a sad expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>"How good of you to have put yourself about
to come so early on my account!" said Bijou,
holding out both her hands to him. He pressed
them to his lips whilst she went on: "Why, it is
scarcely eight o'clock! you must have started from
La Norinière awfully early!"</p>

<p>"Don't let us trouble about me; but tell me how
you are?"</p>

<p>"Why, I am perfectly well, thank you! You
saw yesterday that I followed the paper-chase just
as though I had not had any fall beforehand; and
then, in the evening at the theatre, I did not look
ill, did I?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly ill; but at the theatre it
seemed to me that you were a little excitable and
nervous." And then he added sadly: "I did not
see much of you though, either; you scarcely
troubled about anyone but Hubert de Bernès, and
you quite forsook your poor old friend."</p>

<p>She got up and went to him.</p>

<p>"Oh! how can you imagine&mdash;" she began, in a
coaxing way, but he interrupted her.</p>

<p>"I did not imagine, alas! I saw for myself;
and I am not reproaching you, my dear little girl&mdash;young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
people of course prefer young people, it is
quite natural!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Bijou, with evident sincerity;
"not at all&mdash;I am not so fond as all that of young
people generally; and, above all, I cannot endure
young men about the age of M. de
Bernès."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember that you told me that once
before; you said so the first time I saw you; it was
here in this room, when we were waiting together
for the arrival of your guests to dinner."</p>

<p>Denyse laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, what a memory you have!"</p>

<p>"Always, when it is a question of you." And
then, in a voice which trembled slightly, he asked:
"Do you remember something you said to me
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yesterday, when I was holding you in my
arms, and you were nestling against me like a little
trembling bird!"</p>

<p>Bijou appeared to be trying to remember what
it was. She opened her large eyes wide, and they
looked just then like pale violets.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know what it was; I don't remember!
I was a little upset after my accident,
you know!" And then, as M. de Clagny remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
silent, she asked: "Tell me, what could I
have said that was so interesting?"</p>

<p>He repeated her words slowly, watching Bijou
all the time attentively, as she listened with an
amused air, her pretty lips parted.</p>

<p>"You said, 'I am so happy like this; I should
like to stay here always.'"</p>

<p>"I don't remember saying that; but, anyhow, I
was quite right, because it was perfectly true,
you know!"</p>

<p>He drew Bijou to him, and asked:</p>

<p>"Truly, would it not alarm you to see me always
near you like that?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, it would not alarm me! Oh, no, not
at all!"</p>

<p>"Really and truly?"</p>

<p>"Really and truly! but why do you ask me that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for no reason at all. Do you know
whether Madame de Bracieux is up yet?"</p>

<p>"She does not get up before half-past eight or
nine o'clock, especially when she is up late like
last night; it was nearly two o'clock when we came
in!"</p>

<p>"And you are just as fresh-looking and as pretty
as though you had slept all night. Really, though,
I should very much like to see Madame de
Bracieux."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"You want to speak to her yourself, or is it any
message I can take to her from you?"</p>

<p>"No; I want to speak to her myself."</p>

<p>"Well, you know she will probably keep you
waiting 'a spell,' as they say in this part of the
world."</p>

<p>"Well, I will wait."</p>

<p>Bijou looked at M. de Clagny in surprise. He
was pacing up and down the long room.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked at last, in her
curiosity, "for there certainly is something the
matter!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! You keep marching backwards and
forwards. That reminds me&mdash;one day I saw Paul
de Rueille pacing about like that."</p>

<p>"I saw him, too; it was the night of the La
Balue, Juzencourt &amp; Co.'s dinner, whilst you were
singing."</p>

<p>"No, oh, no! It was one day when he had
some ridiculous duel, and he did not know whether
it would be better to tell Bertrade, or not to tell
her."</p>

<p>"And what did he do?"</p>

<p>"I fancy he did not tell her anything about
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, he had more pluck than I have."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you a duel on?" Bijou asked impetuously.</p>

<p>"A duel if you like to call it that; and a
ridiculous one most certainly&mdash;a fight with impossibilities.
You cannot understand that, my
dear little Bijou."</p>

<p>"And you think that grandmamma will understand
it better than I could?"</p>

<p>"I do not know! Anyhow, she will listen to
me, and she will pity me."</p>

<p>"But I, too,&mdash;I would listen, and I would pity
you."</p>

<p>"I should not like to be pitied by you!" he
said, and the expression of his face betrayed deep
suffering.</p>

<p>"You do not care for me, then?" she asked.</p>

<p>M. de Clagny made a movement forward, then
stopping himself, he said, with a calmness that
contrasted strangely with the troubled look in his
eyes and his hoarse voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I do care for you. I care for you
very much, indeed." And then picking up his hat,
which he had put down on one of the tables,
he moved quickly towards the door, which
led on to the terrace. "I will wait in the
park," he said, "until the marchioness can see
me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>When he saw, however, that Bijou had left the
drawing-room, he returned, and sank down on a
chair, looking suddenly much older from the effect
of some mental anxiety which was weighing on
him.</p>

<p>The marchioness did not keep him waiting long.
She entered the room, with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>"Well, you <i>are</i> an early visitor!" she began; but
on seeing the worried look on her old friend's face,
she asked anxiously: "Why, what is it? Whatever
has happened?"</p>

<p>"A great misfortune."</p>

<p>"Tell me?"</p>

<p>"It is precisely for that I have come so early.
You will remember that when I came here for the
first time, a fortnight ago, I was admiring Bijou,
and you reminded me of the fact that she was
your grand-daughter, and might very well be
mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I answered that I knew that perfectly well,
but that all that was mere reasoning, and that
when the heart remains young it does not listen to
reason."</p>

<p>"I remember perfectly well! What then?"</p>

<p>"What then? Well, at present, I love Bijou!
I love her with all my heart!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Absurd!" exclaimed the old lady, lifting her
hands in amazement.</p>

<p>"You are certainly consoling!"</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;my poor, old friend, what do you
want me to say? You do not expect to marry
Bijou, do you?"</p>

<p>His eyes were moist, and his voice choked as he
replied:</p>

<p>"No; I do not expect to! And yet, I beg you
to tell your grand-daughter what I have just confessed
to you. I am fifty-nine. I have twenty-four
thousand pounds a year. I am neither a bad
lot, nor am I utterly repulsive-looking, and I
love her as no other man can love her."</p>

<p>"But only think that you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thirty-eight years older than she is; it is for
me that this difference of age is more to be feared.
Yes, I know that, and I am willing to accept all
the risks of such a disproportion."</p>

<p>"And she?"</p>

<p>"She? Well, let her decide for or against me.
She is twenty-one; she is no longer a child, and
she knows what she is about."</p>

<p>"Yes; but that does not prevent me from
having a certain amount of responsibility, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, you see; you are afraid that she may
consent!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Afraid? oh, dear, no! I am quite convinced
that such an ideal little creature has, about the
man she dreams of for her husband, a vision of
someone quite different from you."</p>

<p>"And, supposing, by chance&mdash;I do not expect
this at all&mdash;but, supposing you were mistaken,
what should you do?"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. And it is just this&mdash;I am afraid
that you would use your influence with Bijou."</p>

<p>"No; I shall just tell her what I think; I ought
to, under the circumstances&mdash;but nothing more."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>are</i> going to speak to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"May I come again a little later?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! give me until to-morrow. I shall not
speak to her, probably, before this evening; but
that need not prevent your coming to dinner
if you feel inclined to. It was for the&mdash;for
the answer that I was putting you off until
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"If she should refuse, I shall go away."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how can I care where?&mdash;my life will
be over. I shall go and finish my days in some
out-of-the-way spot."</p>

<p>"You talked like that some twelve years ago;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and here you are to-day&mdash;I cannot say younger
than then." The marchioness stopped short, and
then continued, with a smile: "Why should I
not say it, though? You really do seem younger
to me now than you did in those days; you are
perfectly astonishing, my dear friend, anyone would
think you were about forty-five."</p>

<p>"If only it were true what you say!"</p>

<p>"It is, I assure you! but you know that does
not alter the fact that you are fifty-nine."</p>

<p>M. de Clagny rose to take his leave.</p>

<p>"Farewell!" he said, "until to-morrow." And
then, with a pathetic little smile, he added: "Or
until this evening. Yes,&mdash;towards the end of the
day I shall be taken with a violent desire to see
her again, and I shall come as I did the day before
yesterday, and Thursday, and every day."</p>

<p>He took Madame de Bracieux's hand in his, and
clasped it nervously, as he murmured:</p>

<p>"For the sake of our long friendship, I beg you,
be merciful to me."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During luncheon the marchioness seemed preoccupied,
and several times M. de Jonzac asked
her what she was thinking about.</p>

<p>"Whatever is it?" he said; "you have certainly
got the blues."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt must have gone to bed very late," said
Jean de Blaye. "I heard you all come in; it must
have been two o'clock." And then, turning to
Bijou, he asked: "And how did you enjoy yourself?
was it nice?"</p>

<p>"Delightful," she answered, in an absent sort of
way.</p>

<p>"That little Lisette Renaud is perfectly charming,"
said M. de Rueille, "with her beautiful,
large sad eyes. You liked her, too, did you not,
grandmamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Madame de Bracieux, "she is
perfectly fascinating, and she has an admirable
voice. I was astonished to find all that in Pont-sur-Loire;
astonished, too, at the elegance of the
house. There were plenty of pretty women, and
very well dressed, too."</p>

<p>"Nearly all of them wore pink," put in Denyse,
"I noticed that."</p>

<p>"Oh! that is through you," said M. de Rueille.
"The Pont-sur-Loire ladies see you always arrayed
in pink, and as you are considered by them to be
<i>tip-top</i>, they have taken to pink, too." And seeing
that Bijou looked surprised, he asked: "Well,
isn't that quite clear enough?"</p>

<p>"It is quite clear," she answered, laughing, "but
a trifle imaginary. No one pays any attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
me, my dear Paul." And then, as Madame de
Rueille turned towards her, Bijou appealed to her:
"What do you think about the matter, Bertrade?"</p>

<p>"I think that you are too modest."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Giraud, who was gazing at the
young girl with admiring eyes, "Mademoiselle
Denyse is too modest. Yesterday evening everyone
in the house was looking at her, and even the
actress herself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's your imagination, Monsieur Giraud!" exclaimed
Bijou, interrupting him hastily. "I never
noticed that anyone was interested in our box;
but even if they were, it does not follow necessarily
that it was at me that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Evidently not," remarked Henry de Bracieux,
in a chaffing tone. "It was grandmamma in
whom the natives were so deeply interested."</p>

<p>"No! but it might have been Jeanne Dubuisson."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true! She is not known at all in
Pont-sur-Loire, therefore the sight of her would
naturally make a sensation."</p>

<p>Bijou shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You know that I have a horror of people
making a fuss about me, and you say things like
this all the time to tease me."</p>

<p>"If you have a horror of making a sensation,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
exclaimed Pierrot, "that great Gisèle de la Balue
is not like you, I can tell you. She's one who
would change places with you. Yesterday, at the
paper-chase feed, she was bothering round everyone
like a great meat-fly; even Bernès sent her about
her business."</p>

<p>"I think young Bernès is very nice," said the
marchioness. "I was noticing him all the evening
yesterday, and I like him very much. He is very
natural, has good manners, and is not by any
means stupid."</p>

<p>Jean de Blaye noticed that Bijou was screwing
up her lips into a little pout of indifference.</p>

<p>"You don't appear to be of the same opinion as
grandmamma?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me! Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"Well, you are not enthusiastic; you may as
well own it."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I own it."</p>

<p>The marchioness turned to her grand-daughter:</p>

<p>"Ah! and what have you against him?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing, grandmamma, nothing at all!
I think he is just like everyone else, and so when I
see him I can't go into ecstasies over him&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>"I fancy," remarked M. de Rueille, "that the
man isn't born yet about whom you would go into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
ecstasies. You are very good-hearted, very indulgent.
You look upon everyone as all very well in
a negative sort of way, but, practically, it is quite
another matter."</p>

<p>"Oh, you exaggerate!"</p>

<p>"I exaggerate? Well, then, just mention one
man, one only, who is according to your fancy."</p>

<p>"Why, M. de Clagny, for instance!"</p>

<p>"You think he is nice; you like him?" said the
marchioness. "Yes, but how? You would not
marry him, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" answered Bijou, laughing, "I don't
want to marry him."</p>

<p>Just as they were all leaving the table, Jean de
Blaye asked:</p>

<p>"Has anyone any commissions for Pont-sur-Loire?"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Bijou, in surprise, "you are
going off to Pont-sur-Loire like that, all by yourself?
Why, whatever are you going to do there, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>"What am I going to do there?" he said, slightly
disconcerted. "Why, I have some things to get."</p>

<p>"Will you take me?"</p>

<p>"Take you? But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ever since the evening when he had told Bijou
that he loved her, he had avoided, as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
possible, all opportunities of being alone with her.
She, on her part, had not changed her behaviour
towards him or Henry de Bracieux in any way.
She was just as free and cordial in her manner
with them as she had been before refusing them
her hand; and, indeed, it seemed as though she
had forgotten they had proposed to her.</p>

<p>"What?"&mdash;she asked, looking astonished.
"You won't take me with you?"</p>

<p>Thoroughly uncomfortable, and dreading the
long <i>tête-à-tête</i>, yet not daring in the presence of
all the others to refuse to take Bijou, he answered,
in a joking tone:</p>

<p>"Why, yes! On the contrary, I am highly
flattered by the honour you are doing me!"</p>

<p>"That's all right, then. You are very kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, very; but, all the same, you will have
to take someone else to be with you as well,
because I have some business."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Denyse, in a disappointed tone,
"you don't want me with you when we get there."</p>

<p>"But, Bijou, my dear," put in Madame de
Bracieux, "you could not, anyhow, go there&mdash;just
you two! It does not matter if Jean is your first
cousin; it would not be the thing, you know! You
must take Josephine with you; and even then I
don't know whether I ought to allow it&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"But whatever do you want to do in Pont-sur-Loire?"
she added, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Oh, only some errands, grandmamma; you forget
that there are always errands to be done for the
house. And then, too, I can go and see Jeanne; it is
just the day when M. Spiegel is busy and does not
go so that I shall not interrupt their billing and
cooing."</p>

<p>"It does not seem to me as though they do much
billing and cooing!" said M. de Jonzac. "I was
watching them yesterday at the paper-chase, and
I'm very much mistaken if that engagement is
not a very half-and-half sort of affair."</p>

<p>"But why should you think that, Uncle Alexis?"
asked Bijou, looking troubled.</p>

<p>"Because the girl looks sad, and the professor
indifferent. Haven't you noticed that?"</p>

<p>"No; but then I don't notice things much," she
answered.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the way from Bracieux to Pont-sur-Loire,
Bijou and Jean were silent.</p>

<p>In the town just near the station, they met
Madame de Nézel, who had come in from The
Pines by the half-past two train. On seeing her,
Bijou made a little movement, and was just about
to speak to her cousin, but, on second thoughts, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
said nothing, and only looked up at him, with a
sweet expression in her bright eyes. Jean, feeling
awkward and confused, had pretended not to see
Madame de Nézel, and she, instead of going on
into the centre of the town, had turned down
a narrow street, by some waste ground and
gardens. As she got out of the carriage with
Josephine at the Dubuissons' door, Bijou asked:</p>

<p>"Where shall I find you? And at what
time?"</p>

<p>"At the hotel; I will tell them to put the horse
in at six o'clock if that will suit you?"</p>

<p>"At six o'clock!" she exclaimed, in astonishment.
"Oh, well! you <i>must</i> have plenty of things
to do! Three hours and a half of shopping in
Pont-sur-Loire!"</p>

<p>Impatient and wishing above all things to
escape Bijou's innocent questioning, Jean offered
to start earlier, but she refused.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! why should you? I shall be delighted
to stay as long as you wish with Jeanne!"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Dubuisson was at home. Denyse
thought she looked sad, and her eyes had dark
circles round them.</p>

<p>"What is the matter now?" she asked.
"There's something wrong."</p>

<p>"Yes, things are not quite right."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is&mdash;your <i>fiancé</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just the same."</p>

<p>"Which means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I think he has got&mdash;well&mdash;a little cool.
But there is something else that has upset me to-day."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well! it is an event that really does not
concern me at all; but it has made me feel
wretched all the same." She avoided looking at
Bijou as she continued: "You know that&mdash;Lisette
Renaud?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, she is dead&mdash;this morning."</p>

<p>"Dead!&mdash;What of?"</p>

<p>"People think she killed herself," said Jeanne,
almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"By taking morphia. You know they could
not go into details before me, but I understood,
from what they were saying, that it was after an
explanation she had had with M. de Bernès."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday after the theatre, or else this morning.
Papa and M. Spiegel were talking of it at
luncheon; but in a vague sort of way, so that I
should not understand."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"How fearfully sad!&mdash;I can quite understand
that it should have upset you."</p>

<p>"Yes; it is only natural, and all the more so as,
just now, troubles from love affairs touch me very
nearly&mdash;and for a good reason!" she added, with a
sad little smile.</p>

<p>"That poor little actress!" said Bijou, in a tone
of regret. "As a rule, I don't care much for
women who are on the stage, but this one seemed
to be nice, and then, she really did sing well&mdash;it is
a pity!&mdash;M. de Bernès must be wretched!"</p>

<p>"Do you think people really are so wretched
when they cause others to suffer?" asked Jeanne,
still not looking at Bijou. "I don't think they
are! There are the thoughtless people, who make
others suffer without knowing it, and then there
are the others, who cause people to suffer because
it amuses them; and neither the former nor the
latter know what it is to feel remorse&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Jeanne stood still, lost in thought, a far-away
look in her eyes, Bijou stroked her friend's
face gently.</p>

<p>"There, don't think any more about these sad
things, Jeanne, dear," she said. "Your grief won't
change anything when the mischief is already done,
and you are making yourself wretched all in vain.
Come, now, let us talk about our play, and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
dress, or no matter what&mdash;oh! by the bye, about
dress, does yours fit well at last?"</p>

<p>"It fits; but it does not suit me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's impossible!"</p>

<p>"No, it's very natural, on the contrary! I
have not your complexion, remember! I am
paler than you are, and that pink makes me paler
still; and then I am thin, and the little gathered
bodice, which shows up your pretty figure to perfection,
makes me look no figure at all&mdash;it does
not matter, though&mdash;it's of no importance whatever!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by saying it is of no
importance?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, don't you see, Bijou dear, that
whether one is well or badly dressed, if one is just
common-place as I am, one would always pass
unnoticed by the side of anyone as beautiful as
you are."</p>

<p>Bijou turned her eyes up towards the ceiling,
and said, in a half-serious, half-joking way:</p>

<p>"My poor dear child, you are wandering&mdash;you
don't know at all what you are talking about!"
And then suddenly changing her tone she asked:
"What time do you start to the races to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Papa will have arranged that
with M. Spiegel. Ah, tell me! shall you go early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to the Tourvilles' dance? I don't want to get
there before you."</p>

<p>Denyse was looking at her watch.</p>

<p>"Oh! I must go!" she exclaimed. "They
want some gardenias at home for button-holes; I
don't know where I shall be able to get any; someone
told me of a florist up by the station somewhere."</p>

<p>"By the station? but there are only market-gardeners
there, no florists."</p>

<p>"Yes, it seems that in that little lane&mdash;you
know&mdash;to the right of the quay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lilac Lane, I know where you mean; but there
are only vegetable gardens there, and some waste
ground, and then a few small houses, that are
generally rented by officers because they are near
to the barracks."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," said Bijou, getting up, "I'll go
and look round there!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Denyse was the first to arrive at the hotel.
Jean de Blaye was rather behind time, and when
he did appear, he looked sad, and his face was very
pale. He had met Madame de Nézel by appointment,
but she had only come to break off entirely
with him, and this freedom was of no use to him
now; but, at the same time, there was nothing left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
for him to do but accept his fate. They were both
wretched and discontented with each other, and
yet they had been obliged to stay together at their
trysting-place, because Bijou, escorted by the old
housekeeper Josephine, had been rambling up and
down the lonely lane for a good part of the afternoon.
She had gone backwards and forwards as
though in search of something, and with a persistency
which Jean could not understand, and
which made him feel very uneasy.</p>

<p>When they were driving across the square by
the station at three o'clock, she had, perhaps, seen
Madame de Nézel turning down Lilac Lane. If
that were so, she had probably wanted to assure
herself whether her suspicions were correct. How
inquisitive and fond of ferreting she must be, then&mdash;this
Denyse whom he loved so dearly, and who
had, without knowing it, ruined his whole life.</p>

<p>He apologised for his unpunctuality, and helped
Bijou into the carriage, whilst she assured him in
the sweetest way that he was not late at all.</p>

<p>Just as he was wondering how he could ask her
what she had been doing, she volunteered the
information he wanted.</p>

<p>"Do you know you will have your gardenias for
to-morrow after all? But it <i>has</i> been difficult to
get them. I have been running about all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Pont-sur-Loire nearly all the afternoon. They
sent me to the queerest little streets, where I got
lost, and never found the place at all."</p>

<p>Delighted at this proof of Bijou's innocence,
Jean exclaimed involuntarily:</p>

<p>"Ah! that was what you were hanging about
for in Lilac Lane?"</p>

<p>She fixed her large astonished eyes on him, as
she asked:</p>

<p>"However did you know? Did you see me?"</p>

<p>"I did not," he answered quickly; "one of my
friends told me."</p>

<p>"Who was it? Do I know him&mdash;your friend?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so; he's an officer in Bernès'
regiment. Ah, by the bye, what do you think!
The poor little actress you heard last night&mdash;well,
she has killed herself!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; it is a great pity!"</p>

<p>Bijou said this in a tone which made it impossible
to continue the conversation on this topic.
She was so dignified, and her meaning was so
plain, that Jean almost regretted having said a
word to her of this affair, considering that it was a
trifle delicate; but, after all, as he said to himself,
Bijou was no child; she would soon be twenty-two!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At four o'clock, M. de Clagny arrived at
Bracieux, his heart beating fast at the thought of
seeing Bijou again, and of seeing her quite free
and unconstrained as usual, for she would not yet
know of his proposal.</p>

<p>He was very much disappointed on hearing that
she was at Pont-sur-Loire, and that she had gone
there with Jean. He asked the marchioness to
tell him candidly just what she thought would be
the result of his advances with reference to the
young girl, and Madame de Bracieux replied that
she could not approach the subject now, as
Denyse had declared to them all that very morning
that "she thought M. de Clagny charming,
but that she should not like to marry him."</p>

<p>He stood the shock fairly well, but insisted that
Bijou should be told that evening of his proposal.
She would then have until the next day to think
it over, and that was what he wished.</p>

<p>Denyse and Jean returned just at dinner-time.
When they came downstairs, everyone was at the
table, and the topic of conversation was the death
of poor Lisette Renaud.</p>

<p>M. de Rueille had been out riding, and had met
some officers, who were on duty there, and who
had, of course, told him the story.</p>

<p>"It is fearful," said Bertrade, "to think of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
poor girl killing herself; she was so pretty, and so
young."</p>

<p>"It is just because one is young that one would
commit suicide, if unhappy; otherwise one would
have to go on being wretched for so long a time,"
said Giraud in a strange voice, which resounded
in the spacious dining-room.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> marchioness decided not to speak to Bijou
about M. de Clagny that evening, as she did not
want to disturb the young girl's rest.</p>

<p>The following morning, however, she sent for
her, and Bijou arrived, gay and lively as usual.
She gave a little pout of disappointment when her
grandmother informed her that she wished to
speak to her about something very serious.</p>

<p>"It concerns one of my greatest friends," began
Madame de Bracieux, "and he is also a friend of
yours."</p>

<p>"M. de Clagny?" interrupted Bijou.</p>

<p>"Yes, M. de Clagny. You must have seen that
he is very fond of you, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I am very fond of him, too, very fond of him."</p>

<p>"Exactly, but you care for him as though he
were your father, or a delightful old uncle, whilst
he does not care for you either as though you were
his daughter, or niece; in short, you will be very
much astonished&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Astonished at what?" asked Bijou timidly.</p>

<p>"At&mdash;well, he wants to marry you, that's the
long and short of it."</p>

<p>"He, too?" murmured the young girl, looking
bewildered.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'he, too'?" exclaimed
the marchioness, bewildered in her turn; "who else
wants to marry you that you say 'he, too '?"</p>

<p>Denyse blushed crimson.</p>

<p>"I ought to have told you all that before, grandmamma,"
she said, sitting down on a little stool
at Madame de Bracieux's feet; "but we have been
so dissipated just lately, what with the paper-chase,
the theatre, the races, and the dances, that
I don't seem to have had a minute, and then, too,
it was not very interesting either."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's your opinion, is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, considering that I don't want to marry
either of them."</p>

<p>"Well, but who is it, child, who is it?" asked
the marchioness.</p>

<p>"Why, just Henry and Jean. Jean spoke to
me first for Henry, who, it seems, had got him to
ask me whether I would allow him to ask your
permission to marry me. I answered that he
ought to have asked <i>you</i> first and not me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are a real little Bijou, my darling."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that it really did not matter, as I did not
want to marry him."</p>

<p>"He is not rich enough for you, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know anything about that. And
then, too, all that is quite the same to me, but I
should not like Henry for a husband. I know
him too well."</p>

<p>"Ah! and what about Jean?"</p>

<p>"Jean, too, I should not like as a husband. That
is just what I told him, when, after I had refused
Henry, he began again on his own account."</p>

<p>"They go ahead&mdash;my grandchildren. Now I
can understand how it is that, for the last few days,
they have had faces as long as fiddles."</p>

<p>There was a short silence, and then Madame de
Bracieux remarked, as though in conclusion:</p>

<p>"I know then, now, what your answer is to my
poor old friend Clagny."</p>

<p>"How do you know, though?"</p>

<p>"Because if you will not have either of your
cousins, who are, both of them, in their different
ways, very taking, it is scarcely probable that you
would accept an old friend of your grandmother's."</p>

<p>"But he, too, is very taking!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true; but he is sixty years old!"</p>

<p>"He does not look it!"</p>

<p>"He is though."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know; but that does not make any difference
to the fact that I should not mind marrying him
any more than I should Jean or Henry."</p>

<p>"You do not know what marriage is; you do
not understand."</p>

<p>Bijou half closed her beautiful, bright eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, speaking slowly, "I do understand
quite well, grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Well, all this is no answer for me to give to M.
de Clagny."</p>

<p>"Is he coming to-day?"</p>

<p>"He is coming directly."</p>

<p>Bijou moved uneasily on her footstool, and then,
after a moment's consideration, she said:</p>

<p>"You can tell him, grandmamma, that I am very
much touched, and very much flattered that he
should have thought of me, but that I do not want
to marry yet&mdash;" And then, laying her head on the
marchioness's lap, she added: "because I am too
happy here with you."</p>

<p>"My little Bijou! my darling Bijou!" murmured
Madame de Bracieux, stooping to kiss the pretty
face lifted towards her, "you know what a comfort
you are to me; but, all the same, you cannot stay
for ever with your old grandmother. I am not
saying that, though, in order to persuade you into a
marriage that would be perfect folly."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Denyse looked up at the marchioness, as she
asked:</p>

<p>"Folly? But why folly?"</p>

<p>"Because M. de Clagny is thirty-eight years
older than you are, and he will be quite infirm just
when you are in your prime; and such marriages
have certain inconveniences which&mdash;well&mdash;which
you would be the first to find out."</p>

<p>Bijou had risen from her low seat on hearing the
sound of carriage-wheels, which drew up in front of
the hall-door. She looked through the window,
and then ran away, saying:</p>

<p>"Here he is, grandmamma!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During luncheon, Madame de Bracieux announced,
in a careless, indifferent way:</p>

<p>"M. de Clagny is leaving here; he came to say
good-bye to me this morning."</p>

<p>Bijou looked up, and Jean de Blaye remarked:</p>

<p>"He is leaving here? Why, it seemed as
though he had taken root in this part of the
world."</p>

<p>"Oh," put in M. de Rueille, "old Clagny's roots
are never very deep."</p>

<p>Bijou turned towards the marchioness.</p>

<p>"When is he leaving, grandmamma?" she asked
anxiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, at once; to-morrow, I think. Anyhow,
we shall see him to-night at Tourville; he is going
to the ball in order to see everyone to whom he
wants to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"And he is not going to the races?"</p>

<p>"No, he is busy packing."</p>

<p>"And our play to-morrow!" exclaimed Denyse,
in consternation. "He had promised me over and
over again to come to it."</p>

<p>The marchioness glanced at her grand-daughter,
and said to herself that, decidedly, even with the
kindest heart in the world, youth knows no pity.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Bijou's arrival at the Tourville ball was a veritable
triumph. In her pink crêpe dress, which
matched her complexion admirably, she looked
wonderfully pretty, and different from anyone else.</p>

<p>"Just look at the Dubuisson girl," said Louis de
la Balue to M. de Juzencourt. "She has tried to get
herself up like Mademoiselle de Courtaix. She
has copied her dress exactly, and just see what she
looks like. She might pass for her maid, and
that's the most she could do. How is it, now?"</p>

<p>M. de Juzencourt laughed gruffly.</p>

<p>"Why, it's just that if the outside is the same,
what's inside it isn't the same. Isn't she going
to be married?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, she's going to marry a young Huguenot,
who must be somewhere about, hiding in some
corner or another. Ah! No! he isn't in a corner
either. There he is, like all the others, fluttering
round 'The Bijou.'"</p>

<p>"And you? You don't flutter round her?"
asked M. de Juzencourt.</p>

<p>"I? I'd marry her&mdash;because, sooner or later,
one's got to get married, or one's parents make a
fuss, because of keeping up the name, you know&mdash;but
as to fluttering round&mdash;By Jove, no! that
isn't in my line!" and then, in a languid way, he
went off to Henry de Bracieux.</p>

<p>"How hot it is," he began, glancing at him
dreamily, and speaking in a low voice, with an
affected drawl. "You are lucky not to turn red.
You've got such a complexion, though, that's true.
You look like a regular Hercules, and yet, with
that, your complexion is as delicate&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he was leaning towards him, and looking
sentimental, Henry exclaimed impatiently, in his
full, sonorous voice:</p>

<p>"Oh! hang my complexion!" and turning
away, he left young La Balue planted there in
the middle of the drawing-room, and went off
himself to Jean de Blaye, who, with a melancholy
expression on his face, was standing at some distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
off, watching Bijou through the intricacies of
a dance, for which six partners had all tried to
claim her.</p>

<p>When M. de Clagny approached Denyse, and
bowed to her ceremoniously, she said at once,
without even returning his bow:</p>

<p>"Grandmamma has told me that you are going
away. I am sure that it is because of me?"</p>

<p>He nodded assent, and she put her little hand
through his arm, and moved in the direction of
another room, which was almost empty.</p>

<p>"Please," she began, in a beseeching tone,
"please, do not go away."</p>

<p>"And I, in my turn," he answered, deeply
moved, "must say, please, Bijou, do not ask what
is impossible. I have not been able to be with
you without getting as foolish as all the others.
I have let myself go on dreaming, just as fools
dream, and now that all is over, I must try to become
wise again, and to forget my dream, and in
order to do that I must go away, very far away, too."</p>

<p>"You thought that&mdash;that I should say yes?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you were so good to me, so sweet and
confiding always, that I did hope&mdash;yes, God help
me&mdash;I did hope&mdash;that perhaps you would let
me go on loving you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so it was my fault that you hoped that?"
she said dreamily.</p>

<p>"It wasn't your fault&mdash;it was mine; one always
does hope what one wants."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure that I ought not to have behaved
as I did with you." And her eyes filled with
tears as she murmured, almost humbly: "I am
so sorry! will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Bijou!" exclaimed M. de Clagny, almost
beside himself. "My dear Bijou, it is I who ought
to ask your forgiveness for causing you a moment's
sadness."</p>

<p>"Well, then, be kind&mdash;don't go away! not to-morrow,
at any rate! Promise me that you will
come to Bracieux to-morrow to see us act our
play! Oh, don't say no! And then, afterwards,
I will talk to you&mdash;better than I could this
evening." And gazing up at him with her soft,
luminous eyes, she added: "You won't regret
coming, I am sure."</p>

<p>Jean de Blaye was just passing by at that
moment, and Bijou stopped him, and said, in a
coaxing way:</p>

<p>"Won't you ask me for a waltz? do, please, you
waltz so well."</p>

<p>And laying her hand on his shoulder, she disappeared,
just as Pierrot arrived to claim his dance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leave your cousin in peace," said M. de
Jonzac, who was seated on a divan watching the
dancing. "You are much too young to ask girls
to dance with you&mdash;I mean girls like Bijou."</p>

<p>"Ah, how old must I be then before I can ask
them&mdash;not as old as you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"You certainly have a nice way of saying
things."</p>

<p>"I say, father, why do Jean and Henry say that
young La Balue gets to be worse and worse form?"</p>

<p>"Young La Balue? Oh, I don't know."</p>

<p>"They say that he makes himself up."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>"And that he gets to be worse and worse
form! How?"</p>

<p>"If you want to know how, you have only to
ask your cousins: they will tell you."</p>

<p>"They won't, though! I asked them, and Jean
just said, 'Don't come bothering here.' Are we
going home soon?"</p>

<p>"Going home? why, your cousin is sure to stay
for the cotillion."</p>

<p>"I was very stupid to come here instead of
staying with M. Giraud and the abbé."</p>

<p>"Ah, by the bye, why didn't he come&mdash;M.
Giraud? Bijou asked for an invitation for him."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he wouldn't come: he is awfully down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
in the dumps, and has been for some time. He
doesn't eat, and he doesn't sleep either; instead of
going to bed, he goes off walking by the river all
night."</p>

<p>"And you don't know what's the matter with
him?"</p>

<p>"The matter with him! I think it is Bijou that
is the matter with him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Bijou the matter with
him?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, it's the same with Jean, and Henry,
and Paul. You can see very well, father, that
they are all running after her, can't you? not to
speak of old Clagny, who isn't worth counting
now." He stopped a minute, and then finished
off, in a sorrowful way: "and not to speak of me
either, for I don't count yet."</p>

<p>"Oh! you exaggerate all that," said M. de
Jonzac, quite convinced that his son was in the
right, but not wanting to own it. "Bijou is certainly
very pretty, and it is not surprising that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pierrot interrupted his father eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh! it isn't that she is just pretty only, but
she is good, and clever, and jolly, and everything.
They are quite right to fall in love with
her, and, if I were only twenty-five&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you were twenty-five, my dear young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
she would send you about your business, as she
does the others."</p>

<p>"That's very possible," replied Pierrot philosophically,
but at the same time sadly; and then,
pointing to Bijou, who was just standing talking
to Jeanne Dubuisson in the middle of the room, he
said: "Isn't she pretty, though, father? Just look
at her; she is dressed absolutely like Jeanne, their
dresses are just alike, stitch for stitch, as old Mère
Rafut says. I'm sure that, if they mixed them up
when they were not in them themselves, there'd be
no telling which was which after; and yet like that
on them, I mean, they don't look alike at all! Do
you think I might venture to ask her for a dance,
father&mdash;Jeanne Dubuisson?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; she is good-hearted enough to give
you one!"</p>

<p>A minute or two later and Jeanne went off with
Pierrot for the next dance. M. Spiegel crossed
over to Bijou, and asked her for the waltz which
was just commencing, but she shook her head,
saying:</p>

<p>"I am so tired, if you only knew!"</p>

<p>"Only just a little turn, won't you?" he begged.
"Ever since the beginning of the evening I have
not been able to get a single waltz with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; please don't ask me! I do want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
rest; I&mdash;" and then, suddenly making up her mind
to speak out, she said, "Well, then, no; it isn't
that&mdash;I know I am not clever at telling untruths&mdash;I
am not at all tired, but I don't want to waltz with
you, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because?"</p>

<p>"Because I am afraid of hurting Jeanne's feelings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hurting Jeanne's feelings! But how?" he
asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, it sounds very vain what I am going to
say, but I must tell you all the same. Why, I
think that Jeanne worships you to such a degree
that she is jealous of everyone who approaches
you, or who speaks to you, or who looks at you
even!"</p>

<p>M. Spiegel looked displeased; he knitted his
brows, and his placid-looking face suddenly took a
hard expression.</p>

<p>"She has told you so?"</p>

<p>Bijou answered with the eagerness and embarrassment
of anyone feeling compelled to tell
an untruth.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no, I have just imagined it myself;
you know I am so fond of Jeanne! I know
all that passes in her mind, and I should be so
wretched if I caused her any unhappiness&mdash;or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the slightest anxiety; do you understand what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"I understand that you are just an angel of
goodness, mademoiselle, and that it is no wonder
they are all so fond of you!"</p>

<p>Bijou was looking down on the floor, her breath
coming and going quickly, a faint flush had come
into her cheeks, and her nostrils were quivering,
as she listened silently to the young professor's
words.</p>

<p>He put his arm round her waist, took her little
hand in his, as she offered no resistance, and
whirled her off into the midst of the dance. M.
Spiegel waltzed divinely, and Bijou was passionately
fond of the waltz <i>à trois temps</i>. With a flush
on her cheeks, her eyes half-closed, and her lips
parted, showing her dazzling white teeth, she
went on whirling round as long as the orchestra
played. Several times she passed quite close to
Jeanne, without even seeing her poor friend, who
was being jerked about by Pierrot. The youth
kept treading on his partner's toes, or knocking her
against the furniture; and when, now and again,
Jeanne would stop to get breath, Pierrot would
chatter away most eloquently about all kinds of
sports, of which she was absolutely ignorant.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, putting out his enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
foot and his formidable knee, "I am a very second-rate
dancer, but I'm very good at football. Our
team is going to play a match this winter against
the Pont-sur-Loire team; you ought to see it; it
will be first-class! I keep goal; you should just
see what jolly kicks&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off as Jeanne did not speak. She
was looking uneasily at her <i>fiancé</i> as he passed
and re-passed, apparently happy in guiding Bijou
along through the rapid whirl of the dance.</p>

<p>"I am boring you," said Pierrot; "shall we go
on now?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, in a changed voice; "I do not
feel quite myself, and it is so warm! Will you
take me across to papa&mdash;he is playing cards over
there. I should like to go home!"</p>

<p>Whilst they were on their way to M. Dubuisson,
Bijou stopped M. Spiegel just near the orchestra;
and said, in a laughing voice:</p>

<p>"Why, you are indefatigable&mdash;one must get one's
breath, though; besides, the waltz is just finishing
now!"</p>

<p>She glanced at the four wretched musicians, who
were in a deplorable state, with their shiny-looking
coats, their limp shirt-fronts, and their faces bathed
in perspiration.</p>

<p>"Why, Monsieur Sylvestre!" she suddenly exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
"Good evening, Monsieur Sylvestre!
Well, I never! I didn't expect to see you!"</p>

<p>The poor fellow looked up eagerly, and, gazing
at Bijou, with his soft, blue eyes full of deep distress,
he stammered out:</p>

<p>"I did not expect to be seen either, mademoiselle!"</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> going to bed at five in the morning, Bijou
slept for two hours, and when, later on, she went
to the marchioness's room, she looked as fresh and
as thoroughly rested as after a long night's sleep.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma," she said, "I have been thinking
a great deal ever since yesterday."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"Why, about what you told me as regards
M. de Clagny."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the marchioness, rather annoyed at
a subject being brought up again, which she had
thought over and done with.</p>

<p>Rather selfish, like nearly all elderly people, it
seemed to her utterly useless to trouble about
matters which were painful or sad, except just
to settle them off once for all.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," continued Bijou. "And
then, too, I saw M. de Clagny last night at the
ball&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, and what is the result of all this thinking
and of this interview?" asked the marchioness,
rather anxiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"The result is that I have changed my mind."</p>

<p>"What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say that, with your permission, I will marry
M. de Clagny."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! you won't do anything of the
kind."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it would be madness."</p>

<p>"Why, no, grandmamma, it would be very wise,
on the contrary; if I did not marry him, I should
never again all my life long have a minute's peace."</p>

<p>"Because?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because I have seen that he is dreadfully and
horribly unhappy."</p>

<p>"No doubt; but that will all be forgotten in
time."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it won't be forgotten! And I told you
I like M. de Clagny more than I have ever liked
anyone&mdash;except you; and so the idea that he is
wretched on my account&mdash;and, perhaps, a little
through my fault&mdash;would seem odious to me, and
would make me unhappy&mdash;much more unhappy
even than he is."</p>

<p>"But you would be still more so if you married
him. Listen, Bijou, dear, you know nothing about
life, nor about marriage. I have, perhaps, been
wrong in bringing you up so strictly, not letting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
you read or hear enough about things; there are
certain duties and obligations which marriage imposes
upon us, and about which you know nothing,
and these duties&mdash;well, you ought to know something
about them, before rushing headlong into
such a terrible venture as this."</p>

<p>"No!" said Bijou, with a gesture to prevent
Madame de Bracieux continuing, "don't tell me
anything, grandmamma. I know what responsibilities
I should have to accept, and what my duty
would be, and I have decided&mdash;decided irrevocably&mdash;to
become the wife of M. de Clagny, whom I
love dearly." And then, as the marchioness made
a movement as though to protest, she repeated:
"Yes, I love him dearly; and the proof is that
the idea of marrying him does not terrify me,
whilst the thought of marrying the others made
me feel a sort of repulsion."</p>

<p>She knelt down in front of the marchioness, and
began again in a coaxing voice:</p>

<p>"Say that you will consent, grandmamma; say
so&mdash;do, please."</p>

<p>"You are nearly twenty-two. I cannot overrule
you as though you were a little child, therefore
I consent, but without any enthusiasm, I can
assure you, and I implore you to reconsider the
matter, Bijou, my dear. I am afraid that you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
following the impulse of your kind heart and of
your extremely sensitive nature and making a
mistake that will be irreparable."</p>

<p>"I do not need to consider the matter any more;
I have done nothing else ever since yesterday;
and I know that this is my only chance of happiness,
or of what at any rate seems to be the most
like happiness. Don't say anything to anyone
about it, will you, grandmamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no! you can be easy on that score;
you don't imagine that I am in a hurry to announce
such an engagement, and to contemplate
the horrified, astonished looks they will all put on.
Oh, no; if you think I am in a hurry, you are
mistaken, my darling."</p>

<p>"And above all, don't say anything to M. de
Clagny; I am enjoying the thought of telling him
this evening."</p>

<p>"But he told me that he should not come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! but he promised me that he would come."
And then, holding up her merry face to be kissed,
she added: "And now I must go and attend to
our scenery, and to the footlights, which won't
light, and to my costume, which is not finished."</p>

<p>The marchioness took Bijou's head in her beautiful
hands, which were still so white and smooth,
and kissing her, murmured:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go, then; and may Heaven grant that we shall
have no cause to regret&mdash;your good-heartedness&mdash;and&mdash;my
weakness."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Dubuissons and M. Spiegel had promised
to come at four o'clock. One of the scenes which
did not go very well had to be rehearsed. Bijou,
who was busy gathering flowers, went towards the
cab when they arrived, and was surprised to see
only Jeanne and her father.</p>

<p>"What have you done with M. Spiegel?" she
asked.</p>

<p>It was M. Dubuisson who answered, in a confused
sort of way:</p>

<p>"He is coming&mdash;with your cousin M. de Rueille,
who was at Pont-sur-Loire and who offered to
bring him."</p>

<p>"Don't disturb your grandmamma," said Jeanne,
taking Bijou's arm. "Papa won't come in yet, he
has his lecture to prepare, and he will go and do
it, walking about in the park." And then, as soon
as M. Dubuisson had moved off, she began again:
"If M. Spiegel and I had not had parts in the
play, and so had not been afraid of spoiling it for
you by not appearing, we should not have come."</p>

<p>"You would not have come?" exclaimed Bijou,
in astonishment; "and why not, pray?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because we are now in the most false and
ridiculous position."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are&mdash;our engagement is broken off."</p>

<p>"Broken off!" repeated Bijou, in consternation;
"broken off! but what for?"</p>

<p>"Because I was quite certain that he cared for
me very little or not at all," answered Jeanne,
speaking very calmly, but not looking at Bijou,
"and so I told him this morning that I did not
feel equal to accepting the life of misery which I
foresaw, and that I gave him back his liberty."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, is it possible&mdash;and you do not
regret anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing! I am very wretched, but my mind is
more easy."</p>

<p>Bijou looked straight into her eyes as she asked:</p>

<p>"And it is&mdash;it is because of me, isn't it? it is
because of M. Spiegel's manner towards me that
you broke it all off?" Jeanne nodded, and Bijou
went on: "And so you really thought that your
<i>fiancé</i> was making love to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as to making love to you, no, perhaps not&mdash;but
he certainly cares for you."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by <i>what then</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well, what would be the end of that for him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it would cause him to suffer; and who
knows, he might have hoped&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Hoped what? to marry me?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes! I don't know; he might have hoped
in a vague sort of way&mdash;I don't know what."</p>

<p>"And do you think that I can endure the idea
of causing your unhappiness, no matter how involuntarily
on my part?"</p>

<p>"It is not in your power to alter what
exists."</p>

<p>Bijou appeared to be turning something over in
her mind.</p>

<p>"Supposing I were to marry," she said at last
abruptly. And then hiding her face in her hands
she said in a broken voice: "M. de Clagny wants
to marry me."</p>

<p>"M. de Clagny!" exclaimed Jeanne, stupefied,
"why, he's sixty!"</p>

<p>"I said no; I will say yes, though."</p>

<p>"You are mad!"</p>

<p>"Not the least bit in the world! I am practical.
The remedy is perhaps a trifle hard, but what is to
be done? I love you so, Jeanne, that the idea of
seeing you unhappy makes me wretched!"</p>

<p>"I assure you, though, that even if you marry
M. de Clagny, I should not marry M. Spiegel.
He said things to me just now which were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
painful, and no matter how much I tried, I could
not forget them."</p>

<p>"Painful things, about what?"</p>

<p>"About my jealousy&mdash;he said that it was
ridiculous&mdash;and yet I had not complained about
anything. I kept it from him as much as possible,
my jealousy; but at the ball, I did not feel well,
and I asked papa to take me home, and he was
displeased about that, he thought I was sulking."</p>

<p>"Oh, all that will soon be forgotten!"</p>

<p>"No! and so you see, Bijou, it would be for
nothing at all that you would commit the very
worst of all follies&mdash;marrying an old man."</p>

<p>"An old man! it's queer, he does not seem to
me at all like an old man&mdash;M. de Clagny! I
should certainly prefer marrying a younger man
and one whom I should like in every respect, but
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jeanne put her arm round Bijou and, resting her
hand on her friend's shoulder, kissed her as she said:</p>

<p>"You must just wait for him in peace, the one
'whom you would like in every respect!' You
have plenty of time!"</p>

<p>"No, I have quite decided! Whatever you do
now will be useless, for, in spite of what you say,
when once the cause of your little misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
has vanished, the misunderstanding will vanish
in the same way. There now, kiss me again, and
tell me that you love me."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Jean de Blaye, who now appeared
with M. Spiegel, "is everyone ready; are we going
to rehearse?"</p>

<p>For the last few days he had been in a nervous,
excitable state, feeling the need of anything that
would take him out of himself, and doing his
utmost all the time to keep himself from thinking.
"Yes," answered Denyse very calmly, wiping
her eyes quickly, "we are ready; we were only
waiting for you." And then, in a very gracious,
natural way, she held out her hand to M. Spiegel,
who took it, saying at the same time:</p>

<p>"You are not too tired, mademoiselle, after such
a late night?" And then, glancing involuntarily
at Mademoiselle Dubuisson's rather sallow-looking
face, he added: "Why, you are looking fresher
even than yesterday."</p>

<p>Jeanne came nearer to Bijou, and, as they moved
away together, she said, pointing to the professor,
and with a look of intense grief in her gentle eyes:</p>

<p>"You see your remedy would not do; he is
incurable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The little play was performed before a large
audience of guests, who were highly amused.
Bijou was so pretty in her costume as Hebe,
she looked so pure and maidenly and so
sweet, that, when the piece was finished, and she
wanted to go and put on her ball-dress, everyone
begged her to remain just as she was.
As she was going away into a side-room to
escape the compliments of the various guests,
M. de Rueille stopped her, and said, in a sarcastic
tone:</p>

<p>"And so that is the costume that was to be
quite the thing, and which, in order to please me,
you were going to get Jean to alter?"</p>

<p>Jean came up just at this moment, with Henry
de Bracieux and Pierrot.</p>

<p>"Accept my compliments," said M. de Rueille
drily, turning towards him; "you certainly know
how to design costumes for pretty girls; but, if I
were you, I would have been rather more
careful."</p>

<p>"Why, what's up with you?" asked Jean, without
even looking at Bijou; "the costume's right
enough!"</p>

<p>"Besides," remarked Bijou tranquilly, "there are
only three persons who have any right to trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
themselves about my costumes&mdash;grandmamma, I
myself, or my husband."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you had one!"</p>

<p>"Certainly; well, I shall be having one!"</p>

<p>Jean de Blaye shrugged his shoulders incredulously,
and Bijou continued:</p>

<p>"I assure you it is quite true! I am going to
be married."</p>

<p>"To whom?" asked M. de Rueille uneasily.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, what a good joke!" remarked Pierrot.</p>

<p>"Whom are you going to marry?" asked Henry
de Bracieux. "Tell us!"</p>

<p>M. de Clagny had just entered the room, and
putting her arm through his, she said, in a mischievous
way, to the others:</p>

<p>"I am going to tell M. de Clagny." And then,
turning to him, she added: "Let us go out-doors,
though; it is stifling in here!"</p>

<p>"Isn't she æsthetic this evening?" murmured
Pierrot, gazing at Bijou's long Grecian cloak of
pale pink. "I should think M. Giraud would think
her perfect to-night; he's always saying she isn't
made for modern costumes."</p>

<p>"Ah, by the bye, where is he&mdash;Giraud?" asked
Jean de Blaye; "he disappeared after dinner, and
we have not seen him again!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Pierrot explained that he must have gone off for
a stroll along the river, as he did nearly every
evening. He was getting more and more odd,
and had fits of gaiety and melancholy, turn by
turn. That very morning he had left the schoolroom
in order to go to Madame de Bracieux, who
had sent to ask him to translate an English letter
for her; and then he had come back some time
after, saying that he had not ventured to knock,
because he could hear that the marchioness was
talking to Mademoiselle Denyse, and ever since
then he had not uttered another word.</p>

<p>"Where the devil's he gone?" asked Jean; and
Pierrot, speaking through his nose, began to imitate
the street vendors on the boulevards.</p>

<p>"Where is Bulgaria? Find Bulgaria!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When she was alone with M. de Clagny under
the big trees, Bijou said, in the sweetest way:</p>

<p>"I came back home this morning, quite wretched
at having caused you any sorrow. It seemed to me
that I must have been too affectionate in my
manner towards you&mdash;too free&mdash;and that I had made
you think something quite different. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is just it&mdash;and so you have no affection
at all for me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know very well that I have!"</p>

<p>"I mean that you like me just as though I were
some old relative or another."</p>

<p>"More than that!"</p>

<p>"Well, but you do not love me enough to&mdash;to&mdash;love
me as a husband?"</p>

<p>"I do not know at all. I cannot understand
myself just what I feel for you. In the first place,
I think you are very nice-looking, and very charming,
too; and then, when you are here, I feel as
though I am surrounded with care and affection.
It seems to me that I breathe more freely, that I
am gayer and happier, and I have never, never felt
like that before&mdash;"</p>

<p>Very much touched by what she was saying, and
very anxious, too, about what she was going to say,
the count pressed Bijou's arm against his without
answering.</p>

<p>"Well, then," she continued, "I thought that, as
I liked you better than I have ever yet liked anyone,
and that, on the other hand, I should never be able
to console myself for having caused you so much
sorrow, the best thing would be to marry you."</p>

<p>M. de Clagny stopped short, and asked, in a
choked voice:</p>

<p>"Then you consent?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My darling!" he stammered out, "my darling!"</p>

<p>"I told grandmamma this morning," continued
Bijou, "and I must confess that she was not
delighted. She did all she could to make me
change my mind."</p>

<p>"I can quite understand that."</p>

<p>"She thinks that it is mad, for you as well as for
me, to marry when there is such disproportion of
age; and then, she did not say so, but I could see
that there was something troubling her, which
troubles me too, though to a much less degree."</p>

<p>"And it is?"</p>

<p>"The disproportion in money matters. Yes&mdash;it
appears that you are horribly rich. Grandmamma
said so yesterday, when she told me that you had
asked for my hand."</p>

<p>"What can it matter, Bijou, dear, whether I am
a little more or less rich?"</p>

<p>"It matters a great deal, with grandmamma's
ideas about things especially. Oh, it is not that
she thinks it humiliating for me to be married
without anything, for I have nothing, you know, in
comparison with what you have! No, she looks
upon marriage as a partnership, or exchange of
what one has. '<i>Give me what you've got, and I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
give you what I've got</i>,' as the country people here
say. Well, you have your name, which is a good
one, and your money, which makes you a very rich
man; on my side, I have my name, which is rather
a good one, too, and my youth, which certainly
counts for something."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, and how can the disproportion
of what we have make your grandmamma
uneasy?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this, you know&mdash;grandmamma is
very fond of me, and she thinks that, as I am
thirty-eight years younger than you, you might die
before me, and that, after living for years in very
great luxury, after letting myself get accustomed
to every comfort, which, up to the present, I have
not had, I might suddenly find myself very poor
and very wretched at an age when it would be too
late to begin life over again, and so I should suffer
very much on account of the bad habits I had contracted,
and which I should not be able to drop&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know very well, my adored Bijou, that
everything I possess is and will be yours. My
will is already made, in which I leave everything to
you, even if you do not become my wife."</p>

<p>"Yes, but she always says a will could be torn
up."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"If your grandmamma would prefer it, I could
make it over to you in a marriage settlement."</p>

<p>Bijou laughed.</p>

<p>"Ah! she would imagine, then, that we might be
divorced, and a divorce does away with all things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, supposing I make out in the marriage
contract that the half of what I possess now is
really yours, and supposing I made over the rest
to you, only reserving to myself the interest?"</p>

<p>Bijou shook her head, and then, with a pretty
movement of playful affection, she threw her soft
arms round M. de Clagny's neck, and said:</p>

<p>"I don't want you to give me anything but
happiness, and I am sure you will give me plenty
of that. I hope you will live a very, very long
time, and it would not matter to me, when I am
old, if I were to find myself poor again, comparatively
speaking."</p>

<p>"And I," he said, covering Denyse's face and
hair with kisses, "I could not go on living with the
thought that I might be taken away without your
future being provided for in the way in which I
should wish it to be."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about all those things," she murmured.
"I want to think that I shall never be
separated from you&mdash;never, never!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Trying, in spite of the darkness, to look into
Bijou's eyes, he asked anxiously:</p>

<p>"Will you be able to love me a little, as I love
you?"</p>

<p>Without answering, she held her pretty lips up
to him, but just at that moment the sound of
voices made them move away from each other
abruptly.</p>

<p>Only a few yards away from them they could
hear several persons talking in low voices, and
also the sound of heavy footsteps walking with
measured tread. It seemed as though just there,
quite near to them, a heavy burden were being
carried along, whilst, in the midst of the darkness,
lights kept passing by.</p>

<p>"It's very odd," said M. de Clagny; "one would
think something had happened."</p>

<p>Bijou, however, who had stopped short, her
heart beating fast with anxiety, struck with the
strangeness of the little procession, put her hand
on the count's arm, and said, quite tranquilly:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! it must be the men going back
to the farm. Just now they are at work up
at the house through the day, and then, when
they have had something to eat, they go back
home."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seemed to me, though, that the lanterns were
on the way towards the house."</p>

<p>She was walking along with her hand on his
arm, and a thrill of joy ran through him as he drew
this beautiful girl, who had just promised herself
to him, closer still, in a passionate embrace.</p>

<p>They returned slowly to the house along the
avenues, meeting several carriages, which were
bearing away the departing guests.</p>

<p>"How's that?" exclaimed Bijou, in surprise.
"They are going away already&mdash;but what about
the cotillion? Is it very late?"</p>

<p>On arriving at the hall-door steps, they met the
La Balues coming towards their carriage.</p>

<p>"How's this?" asked Bijou. "You are going?
But why?"</p>

<p>M. de la Balue mumbled out some unintelligible
words, whilst his son and daughter, looking very
sad, shook hands with Bijou.</p>

<p>"Well, what long faces they are making," remarked
M. de Clagny, beginning to get anxious
in his turn. "Ah! what's that? Whatever's the
matter?"</p>

<p>In the hall there was a long pool of water.
The servants were going backwards and forwards
quickly, looking awestruck, and then Pierrot came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in sight, his eyes swollen with crying, and his
hands full of flowers. Madame de Rueille was
following him, carrying flowers, too.</p>

<p>Bijou stopped short, thunderstruck; but M. de
Clagny hurried up to Madame de Rueille.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he asked.</p>

<p>"M. Giraud has drowned himself," answered
Bertrade. "They have just brought him back
here. It was the miller who found him near the
dam&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then, seeing that Pierrot was gazing at
her in consternation, shaking his flowers about at
the end of his long arms in sheer desperation, she
added, in a hard voice:</p>

<p>"Yes, I know very well that grandmamma has
forbidden anyone to speak of it before Bijou, but,
for my part, I want her to know about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> she stood waiting at the threshold of the little
church for her Uncle Alexis, who was just getting
out of the carriage, Bijou turned round, and, after
giving a little kick to her long white satin train,
and pulling the folds of her veil over her face, she
gazed round at the motley crowd, who were hurrying
towards the church-porch, with that quick look
in her luminous eyes which took in everything at
a glance.</p>

<p>She saw first the profile of Jean de Blaye towering
above the others; he was advancing towards
her with an indifferent, languid expression on his
face, and talking to M. de Rueille, who looked
slightly nervous and excited. Henry de Bracieux,
with a worried look on his face, was listening in
an absent sort of way to the marchioness, as she
gave her orders to the coachman.</p>

<p>Pierrot had got one of the tails of his coat,
which was too short for him, caught in the carriage-door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and, with his big, white-gloved hands, he was
awkwardly endeavouring to get free, but unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>M. Sylvestre, with an enormous roll of music
under his arm, looking very nervous, and in a
great hurry, was rushing towards the staircase
which led to the gallery, without daring to lift his
eyes from the ground; whilst Abbé Courteil,
accompanied by his two pupils, passed by, looking
very business-like&mdash;he, too, not venturing to glance
in the direction of Bijou.</p>

<p>Jeanne Dubuisson, who had got rather thinner,
was waiting with her father until the crowd made
way for her to pass.</p>

<p>Among the Bracieux villagers, and just behind
all the fine ladies and gentlemen, who had come
from Pont-sur-Loire and the country-houses
in the neighbourhood, Charlemagne Lavenue
was pressing forward with long strides. He was
dressed in his best clothes, and his square
shoulders and ruddy complexion seemed to stand
out against the background of blue sky.</p>

<p>As she stood there, with her eyes lowered, looking
as though she had seen nothing, with the sun,
which had brightened up the whole country round
for her marriage, shining full on her, Bijou was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
enjoying to the full the bliss of living, of knowing
herself beautiful, and of being beloved by everyone.</p>

<p>The sound of her Uncle Alexis' voice as he
offered her his arm, and said: "Are you ready?"
woke her up out of her ecstasy.</p>

<p>Very graceful and beautiful she looked, as she
moved along to the music of the organ, which was
pealing forth.</p>

<p>A cabman, who had gone inside the church to
see "the wedding," exclaimed, as Bijou passed up
the aisle:</p>

<p>"Bless my soul! but ain't she a pretty one&mdash;-the
bride?"</p>

<p>Whereupon one of Farmer Lavenue's day-labourers
replied:</p>

<p>"I believe you. And I can tell you what&mdash;she's
as good as she is pretty&mdash;she is! And even
better nor that!"</p>

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
